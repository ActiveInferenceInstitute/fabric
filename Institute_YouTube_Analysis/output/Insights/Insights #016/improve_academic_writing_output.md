**Refined Text:**

Greetings, everyone, and welcome back to "Active Inference Insights." I am your host, Darus Parv Wayne, and today I am pleased to speak with Vana Visa. Vana is a postdoctoral fellow at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, affiliated with the Department of Philosophy. His research focuses on consciousness, mental representation, the philosophy of cognitive science, the philosophy of mind, and, of course, active inference. We share a mutual interest in self-modeling, attention, autopoiesis, intentionality, and much more. I anticipate that these will be among the topics we discuss today. 

Welcome to the show, Vana, and thank you for joining me. 

Thank you for having me. It is a pleasure to be here. As I mentioned in the introduction, we share many interests that may seem niche to some, yet they are relevant to our lived experiences at every moment. Therefore, it is worthwhile to dissect these topics. Interestingly, the first time I heard of you was during a conversation with Jakob Havi, who remarked that you understand Thomas Metzinger's work perhaps better than he does and certainly better than anyone else. 

Could we begin by outlining some of these crucial concepts that may appear counterintuitive to many? For example, when I mention that we both share a love for self-modeling or phenomenal self-modeling, what does this mean? What is the acronym PSM referring to? 

Certainly, as a disclaimer, it is essential to note that Thomas Metzinger knows more about this topic than I do. He coined the term "self-models" and has developed the self-model theory of subjectivity over many years. In fact, I believe there is no living philosopher who has engaged with as much relevant literature on this subject as Thomas, given his lifelong dedication to it. I would never claim to match his depth of knowledge, and it may be beneficial to invite him to this podcast. He has previously accepted an invitation, and I hope to arrange that soon. 

Now, to address your question, I think it is easiest to start with bodily self-models. Imagine a creature or a robot that has a body and must control it. Control can often be enhanced by having a model of the entity being controlled. If one seeks to control their body and interact with the environment, possessing a model of oneâ€™s body and environment can be highly advantageous. This constitutes a form of self-model that is part of a broader world model, which represents relevant aspects of the environment, including one's body.

However, this primitive self-model differs significantly from the more complex self-models that humans possess. A defining feature of our self-models is that we not only have unconscious self-models but also consciously experience the contents of these self-models. This leads us to the notion of a phenomenal self-model, where "phenomenal" refers to conscious experience. When one possesses a phenomenal self-model, they experience their body as their own and recognize their actions as self-directed. This is often referred to as a sense of agency and ownership, both of which can be altered or lost in various contexts.

A relevant example is the robot starfish developed by Josh Bongard and colleagues, which was designed to adapt to changes in its environment and body. Even if one of its limbs becomes damaged, the robot can still control its movements, although it does not possess a phenomenal self-model since it is not conscious.

Let us begin with the body, as it serves as an accessible entry point into the concept of the phenomenal self-model. A potential point of confusion arises from the dual aspect of the body, which Merleau-Ponty describes as both a lived body and an object that can be observed. This raises the question: Is there a difference between saying "I am my body; I live through my body" versus "I have a body"? What do these different aspects of selfhood signify? 

On one hand, the former suggests a perspectival relationship, emphasizing the body as a vehicle through which one engages with the world. In contrast, the latter implies a possession model, where one perceives themselves as a disembodied ego owning a body. Is there a way to reconcile these two canonical features of selfhood: possession and the lived experience associated with the body? 

This is an excellent question. To some extent, these different perspectives can be compatible, depending on the definitions employed. One might wonder whether a non-human animal, lacking a form of consciousness comparable to human experience, nonetheless lives through its body. While such animals may have a lived body, they may not possess the reflective self-awareness that humans do, which allows for richer forms of bodily experience. In moments of intense physical activity, such as playing sports, one may not consciously reflect on their bodily movements. Instead, they simply "live through" their body.

A relevant paper that my colleagues and I authored on flow states delves into this very topic, examining how such states can be grounded in a self-modeling architecture. We propose a distinction between a minimal phenomenal self, which encompasses basic aspects of selfhood such as "mineness," presentness, and perspectival awareness, and strong epistemic agency, which emerges during reflective processes such as planning and communication.

In this context, it is crucial to differentiate between pre-reflective self-awareness and reflective self-awareness. Reflective self-consciousness represents a metacognitive act in which the self examines its own processes. In flow states, this reflective capacity may be attenuated, leading to questions about whether individuals can simultaneously experience a sense of agency and an awareness of their body.

As we explore these intricate ideas, I am eager to hear your thoughts on how Metzinger's phenomenal self-model can be reconciled with active inference. Active inference posits that cognition is fundamentally inferential. Are the processes generating the phenomenal self-model inferential, or are both processes being modeled by the phenomenal self inferential? 

This is indeed a complex topic. When discussing self-models, we often presuppose the existence of an experienced "I." I think that at its most basic, a bodily self-model involves distinguishing between inner and outer experiences. This distinction is crucial for constructing a phenomenal self-model, yet our experience of selfhood is richer and more complex. 

In more advanced self-models, we not only differentiate between self and non-self but also examine our relationship to the environment, our bodies, and our thoughts. This reflexive aspect enhances the complexity of self-models. However, articulating these concepts can be challenging, and I believe that Thomas Metzinger could provide further clarity on this matter.

To illustrate, Metzinger's 2008 work discusses the empirical approach to phenomenal self-modeling, stating that the subjectively experienced content of the phenomenal self arises from a dynamic data structure within the central nervous system. This representational entity's content is informed by the system's own properties, suggesting that the cognitive system recapitulates its data structures into phenomenal space. 

We could start from this perspective, examining how the brain differentiates between internal and external states and how this informs its modeling processes. The notion of attention becomes crucial here, as it allows the brain to navigate between internal experiences and external objects. 

Ultimately, the brain's ability to distinguish between internal and external states is contingent upon its prior assumptions and may involve delusions. These assumptions can shape the individual's experience, and the implications of self-modeling in this context warrant further exploration.

In conclusion, this discussion touches on various philosophical and empirical questions regarding consciousness, selfhood, and the intricate relationships between cognitive processes. As we continue to investigate these topics, I look forward to deepening our understanding through ongoing dialogue and research.
