Active inference is a fascinating concept, but it can be confusing. At its core, it’s about how organisms predict and adapt to their environment. It’s a way of understanding cognition as fundamentally inferential—essentially, our brains are like prediction machines. They generate models of the world and our place in it.

A key idea here is the phenomenal self-model (PSM), which is how we represent ourselves in our own minds. This model is crucial because it informs our actions and decisions. When we think about our bodies or our agency, we’re tapping into this self-model. It’s not just about having a body; it’s about how we consciously experience our existence and actions through that body.

Now, let’s get a bit deeper. The PSM isn’t static; it’s dynamic and can change based on context. For instance, when we’re in a flow state, our sense of self may diminish, yet we’re still acutely aware of our actions. This suggests that self-awareness can exist on a spectrum, where sometimes it’s more about the experience than the explicit reflection on it.

Ultimately, the interplay between self-modeling and active inference offers insights into consciousness. As we engage with our environment, our self-model adapts, shaping our perceptions and actions. Understanding this can deepen our grasp of what it means to be conscious and self-aware in a world that’s constantly changing.
