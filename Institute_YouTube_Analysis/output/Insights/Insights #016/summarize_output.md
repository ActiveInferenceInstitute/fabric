# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The podcast discusses consciousness, self-modeling, and artificial intelligence, exploring philosophical and cognitive science perspectives.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Vana Visa researches consciousness, cognitive science, and active inference at Johannes Gutenberg University.
2. The concept of phenomenal self-modeling (PSM) refers to conscious self-awareness and bodily awareness.
3. Self-models help organisms control their bodies and interact with their environments effectively.
4. Flow states illustrate the relationship between self-awareness and action, impacting cognitive processes.
5. The distinction between "I am my body" and "I have a body" reflects different selfhood perspectives.
6. Active inference posits cognition as fundamentally inferential, involving self-modeling and perception.
7. The podcast explores the relationship between consciousness and artificial intelligence, addressing ethical concerns.
8. The distinction between basic and non-basic minds is based on the presence of representations.
9. Consciousness in artificial systems raises questions about moral status and ethical treatment.
10. Research on necessary conditions for consciousness can help differentiate conscious from non-conscious systems.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding self-modeling is crucial for grasping consciousness and agency in both humans and machines.
2. Flow states provide insight into the interplay between consciousness and bodily experience.
3. Ethical considerations surrounding AI require careful reflection on potential consciousness and moral status.
4. Distinguishing between basic and non-basic minds aids in exploring consciousness across different entities.
5. The relationship between internal states and external perceptions informs theories of consciousness and cognition.
