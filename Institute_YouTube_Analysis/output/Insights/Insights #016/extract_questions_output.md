- I wonder whether we could start by outlining some of these crucial Concepts that sometimes seem a bit counterintuitive to people so for example when I say we both share a love of self-modeling or phenomenal self-modeling what does that mean?
- What is this sort of acronym PSM, the phenomenal self-model?
- I guess um the question here is why do we is there a difference between saying I am my body I live through my body or at or or versus I have a body and what are those different aspects of selfhood?
- Is there a way of coalescing these kind of two canonical features of selfhood one being possession and one being perspectival or association with the lived body?
- I may have butchered it and I’m sure Thomas is pulling his hair out um but maybe we can start there and and then feed in inference and see where it might exist in within those cycles?
- So I I think there’s actually quite complex topic because when we’re talking about self models it it seems to presuppose that there’s already an experienced eye right that I’m I’m I have a body I am moving my hand and so on but I don’t think that’s necessarily already present in in any in in the most basic forms of phenomenal self models and what it’s at least the way I I think about it is that having a at least a bodily self model is mainly about just making a distinction between one between inner and outer as it were so I’m just trying to avoid the word um self and and nonself so a distinction between two types of processes one is the environment and the other is here where I am and and I I think that actually suffices for having a a bodily self model or even a phenomenal self model but of course when we think about or our experience and the way we the different forms of self that we experience there’s there’s more to it there there’s something like an an eye and maybe at this point it’s useful to um bring another aspect of the the self model theory on the table which is the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation so quite PM exactly and so the idea is that there’s in in a complex self model phenomenal self model in which there’s not just a distinction between this belongs to me this does not belong to me this is my body this is not my body and so on well this is my my action or this is an uncon um involuntary movement and so on in more complex self models you also have this this perspectival which um and and subjectivity um in the sense that that you not just make the distinction between what is self and nonself or what is outside and what is inside but also how you are related to the environment how you are related to your your body and how your your thoughts are related to the world and so on so this brings a reflexive component to it and makes it more more complex um I find it a bit difficult to put this into words so Thomas could it is difficult.
- What do you think might be the phenomenological consequences of going up this hierarchy of reflective recursion?
- Is it a concern that we really have to take seriously that if for example we end up making AGI and very importantly that AGI is conscious because I think there’s a really important point there there’s a difference here between intelligence and Consciousness?
- What about the risk of actually creating artificial Consciousness what consequences would that have and should we do it or should should we refrain from even attempting to create artificial Consciousness?
- What happens in the meantime when we have many systems that fulfill some indicators or many but not maybe not so many indicators that we can really be certain that these systems are conscious?
