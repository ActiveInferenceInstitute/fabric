# SUMMARY
Professor Mark SS discusses the intersection of dreams, affect, consciousness, and active inference with Darius, exploring the nature and functions of affective states.

# IDEAS:
- Affects are valenced states with subjective goodness or badness, differing for each individual subject.
- The quality of affective states is categorically differentiated, impacting how needs are perceived and felt.
- Prioritized needs must be felt, guiding voluntary action rather than automatic responses to stimuli.
- Consciousness may serve as a salience filter, determining which needs are prioritized for awareness and action.
- Affective states help organisms navigate uncertainty, providing feedback on actions taken to meet their needs.
- The function of feeling is tied to decision-making, enabling adaptability in unpredictable environments.
- Dreams are dissociated from REM sleep, indicating distinct neurobiological mechanisms for dreaming and REM.
- The seeking system in the brain drives motivation and curiosity, active even during sleep.
- Understanding dreams involves studying the brain systems responsible for generating dreams independently of REM.
- Feeling states are tied to homeostatic mechanisms, providing a subjective layer to biological needs.
- Natural selection favors organisms that can adapt their predictions in novel circumstances, supported by feelings.
- Affective states can influence voluntary actions by providing feedback on current needs and actions.
- The dual aspect monism perspective connects subjective feelings and objective physiological processes.
- Emotions are categorized based on innate homeostatic needs, contrasting with learned emotional concepts.
- Consciousness serves to compress data into manageable representations, aiding decision-making and prioritization.
- The interplay between interoception and exteroception informs the understanding of affective states.
- Affective states can be both innate and learned, shaping individual experiences and responses to needs.
- Research on dreaming has progressed, revealing the role of specific brain circuits in generating dream states.
- Patients with certain brain lesions can dream without REM sleep, indicating separate mechanisms for dreaming.
- Dreams may serve the function of allowing for motivated exploration without disrupting sleep.

# INSIGHTS:
- The subjective nature of affect implies that feelings are essential for survival and adaptive behaviors.
- Affects are crucial for prioritizing needs, enabling organisms to navigate their environments effectively.
- Understanding consciousness requires recognizing the role of feelings in decision-making and voluntary action.
- The dissociation of dreaming and REM sleep reveals the complexity of sleep-related brain functions.
- Homeostatic needs form the foundation of affective experiences, which shape emotional responses and behaviors.
- Evolutionary advantages arise from the ability to adapt predictions based on immediate environmental feedback.
- Consciousness acts as a filter for relevance, shaping how individuals prioritize and respond to needs.
- The dual aspect monism framework emphasizes the interconnectedness of subjective experiences and objective processes.
- Affective states are not merely responses but are integral to understanding human consciousness and behavior.
- Dreams may facilitate mental exploration and problem-solving during states of sleep, contributing to cognitive processing.

# QUOTES:
- "Affect is valanced; there's a goodness and badness to affect, applicable only to the subject."
- "You can’t say I have six out of 10 of sleepiness and six out of 10 of thirst."
- "The feeling of need adds functionality to action, helping monitor attempts to meet those needs."
- "The prioritization of needs is intimately bound up with the experience of consciousness."
- "The mechanism of feeling cannot occur in the dark; it’s inherently subjective and qualitative."
- "Dreaming can occur without REM, indicating distinct mechanisms for these two phenomena."
- "The seeking system drives intense exploratory behaviors, even when one is asleep."
- "Dreams allow for the expression of motivational states without disrupting sleep."
- "Homeostatic mechanisms generate feelings tied to the organism's needs, influencing behavior."
- "Consciousness is felt uncertainty that guides voluntary action in unpredictable environments."
- "It’s an oxymoron to speak of a feeling that you don’t feel."
- "The intrinsic intentionality of self-organizing systems aims to maximize chances of survival."
- "The function of dreaming remains unknown, but it’s crucial to uncouple it from REM sleep."
- "Feelings are vital for navigating novel situations, guiding choices and adaptations."
- "There are many innate homeostatic needs beyond basic emotions that influence our behavior."
- "Affective states are categorical variables and must be understood within their own qualitative contexts."
- "We must discern the laws governing mind and brain from both subjective and objective perspectives."
- "There’s a duality in the nature of consciousness that encompasses both feeling and physiological processes."
- "Not all signals need to be precise to gain attention; goals govern our focus."
- "The brain systems responsible for dreaming provide insight into the biological function of dreams."
