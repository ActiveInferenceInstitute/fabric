🚀✨ Exciting insights from my conversation with Professor Mark SS, a leading neuropsychologist! We explored the fascinating realms of dreams, consciousness, and the intricate dance between affect and cognition. 🧠💭

🌀 Did you know that dreaming and REM sleep aren't the same? Professor SS uncovered this double dissociation, revealing the dopamine system's role in dreaming! 🎉
