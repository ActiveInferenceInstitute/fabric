# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Professor Mark SS discusses the mechanisms of dreams, affect, consciousness, and the role of active inference in understanding these concepts.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Professor Mark SS integrates psychoanalytic theories with modern neuroscience and explores consciousness.
2. Affect is defined as a valenced state with subjective goodness and badness.
3. Different affects are qualitatively distinct, affecting prioritization and conscious awareness.
4. Consciousness serves as a relevance filter, prioritizing needs for survival.
5. Feeling is tied to monitoring needs, guiding voluntary actions in uncertain environments.
6. Dreams can occur without REM sleep, indicating separate mechanisms for dreaming and REM.
7. The misocortical-misolimbic dopamine system drives dreaming, linked to motivated states.
8. Dreaming may serve to manage high arousal states while maintaining sleep.
9. Consciousness adds adaptive advantages in unpredictable environments through enhanced decision-making.
10. Ongoing research aims to further understand the biological function of dreaming.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding affect is crucial for studying consciousness and voluntary action.
2. The relationship between dreams and REM sleep is more complex than previously believed.
3. Consciousness acts as a filter, guiding attention based on prioritized needs.
4. The distinction between innate mechanisms and learned concepts in emotions is significant.
5. Current research continues to uncover the biological functions of dreaming and consciousness.
