Refined Text:

Greetings, everyone, and welcome back to Active Inference Insights. Today, I am privileged to speak with Professor Mark Solms. Professor Solms is a neuropsychologist and psychoanalyst renowned for uncovering the comprehensive brain mechanisms underlying dreams and integrating psychoanalytic theories with contemporary neuroscience. Recently, he has focused on active inference and its potential implications for addressing the profound issue of consciousness. 

Thank you for joining me, Mark. As I mentioned in the introduction, it is truly an honor and a privilege to have you here.

Thank you, Darius. It is a pleasure to be here.

You have been involved in cognitive neuroscience for several decades, yet you have only recently developed an interest in active inference over the past decade. Many individuals, including myself, have found your book, "The Hidden Spring," to be an insightful exploration of the hard problem of consciousness. I appreciate your efforts to approach this complex issue from various perspectives. I have been searching for what I refer to as the synthetic a priori of consciousness, which I define as identifying a cognitive function that necessitates consciousness a priori. For instance, while one might argue that attention is such a function, I can conceive of offline attention where one is mentally engaged without direct consciousness. 

I believe you have proposed that affect is a strong candidate for this synthetic a priori of consciousness. However, "affect" can be a somewhat ambiguous term. To facilitate our discussion, could you please provide a brief definition of what you mean by affect? It would be beneficial to clarify any potential differences between your perspective and those of others, such as James and Barrett's constructionist account of affect.

Yes, that is an important point to address, as the term "affect" can vary in meaning across different contexts. When I refer to affect, I emphasize its valence, indicating that it possesses inherent goodness or badness from the subject's perspective. Thus, an affective state is inherently subjective, meaning it is good or bad only from the individual's point of view, rather than universally or objectively defined.

Additionally, an essential characteristic of affect is that it is qualitatively differentiated; various affects possess unique qualities. For example, the feeling of hunger is qualitatively distinct from thirst or sleepiness. This differentiation is critical because one cannot simply quantify these feelings by adding them together. If one were to state, "I feel six out of ten for sleepiness and six out of ten for thirst," it would inaccurately reduce the complexity of these categorical variables. Therefore, the essential features of affect include its subjective valence and its qualitative differentiation.

This distinction is particularly relevant, especially given your previous debates with Lisa Feldman Barrett regarding the depth of this differentiation. Before we delve deeper into those qualitative distinctions, I would like to explore the concept of relevance and prioritization in relation to consciousness. It seems that whatever enters consciousness is inherently prioritized or deemed relevant to the agent. However, I wonder whether we are potentially placing the cart before the horse by inferring the presence of an agent for whom something is deemed good or bad.

Does the notion of salience, relevance, or priority inherently underlie the goodness or badness of a phenomenal state? My perspective is that the underlying category of need must be considered. For instance, an organism does not feel the need for energy resources when it continuously metabolizes glucose stored in adipose tissue. The need becomes conscious only when it is prioritized, resulting in the feeling of hunger. Therefore, the relationship between prioritization and the emergence of consciousness is intimately connected.

This raises questions about whether the relevance function in consciousness aligns more closely with the synthetic a priori of consciousness than affect itself. To answer this, we must consider what it means to prioritize one need over another. Prioritization is not merely an end in itself; it serves as a guide for action. In the context of synthetic functions, we must clarify which function we are discussing. I argue that the function involves not only the registration of a need but also the feeling associated with that need, which informs how effectively one is attempting to meet it.

Non-prioritized needs operate largely outside of consciousness, as their regulation occurs automatically. However, prioritized needs demand a felt experience because they exist in a state of uncertainty. In these situations, automaticity may prove inadequate, as one must navigate novel or unpredictable circumstances. The feelings associated with these needs guide choices and allow for adaptive responses, resulting in the formation of new predictions that may later be executed unconsciously.

In this context, consciousness may be understood as a means of processing uncertainty. The feeling of need serves as a mechanism for monitoring one's performance in addressing that need. Therefore, consciousness acts as a filter for relevance, which may indeed function as a synthetic a priori of consciousness.

I believe that the critical point is to understand what it means to prioritize needs, as this prioritization is fundamentally linked to action and adaptive behavior. The feeling of need provides a mechanism for navigating uncertainty, and this is crucial for conscious experience.

I appreciate your detailed insights on this matter. I would like to further explore the implications of these ideas in relation to active inference and the concept of metacognitive monitoring. Recent literature has discussed metacognitive awareness in the context of minimizing free energy, and I am curious about the potential offline monitoring of one's ability to minimize free energy. What is it about conscious experience that is adaptive for these free energy-minimizing systems?

I believe that there is indeed something critical about the role of consciousness in this process. However, before I elaborate, I want to clarify that I do not necessarily classify the mechanism I described as purely metacognitive. There is a distinction between the raw feeling associated with a state and the cognitive representation of that feeling. 

To answer your question, it is essential to understand the intrinsic nature of a self-organizing system. Such systems possess an innate drive to maximize their chances of survival, which implies an inherent goal-directedness. The monitoring of one’s performance in fulfilling needs is an essential component of this process. The distinction between feeling and cognition is important, as the feeling of need informs the system about its current state and guides adaptive behavior.

Your inquiry into whether this monitoring can occur offline raises interesting philosophical questions. While I acknowledge that certain processes may be conducted without consciousness, I assert that the subjective nature of feeling is intrinsic to the experience itself. The mechanism of feeling is inherently subjective and qualitatively differentiated, meaning it cannot occur in the absence of consciousness.

Your perspective on the possibility of a non-subjective consciousness as an adaptive mechanism is intriguing. However, I argue that the subjective nature of feeling is essential for guiding behavior and decision-making. If a system possesses the capacity for self-organization and adaptation, it must also have a subjective perspective to facilitate effective navigation through unpredictable environments.

Now, regarding the evolutionary aspect of consciousness, I contend that the emergence of feelings is a vital adaptation for survival. While it may be possible for a system to function without consciousness, the ability to feel enhances an organism's capacity to navigate complex and unpredictable environments. The development of feelings serves to inform decision-making and guide behavior, ultimately contributing to the organism’s adaptive success.

In conclusion, while it is conceivable that a non-conscious system could exhibit adaptive behaviors, the integration of feelings and consciousness enhances the organism's ability to respond to its environment effectively. The presence of feelings provides a nuanced understanding of an organism's needs and facilitates voluntary actions that promote survival.

I appreciate your willingness to engage in this philosophical discourse. As we explore these concepts, it is crucial to recognize the interplay between consciousness, feelings, and adaptive behavior. 

Now, shifting focus to your earlier work on dreams, you have made significant contributions to our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying dreaming, particularly in demonstrating the dissociation between REM sleep and dreaming. Can you discuss the progress that has been made in this area and any insights gained into the function of dreaming?

Thank you for raising this important topic. My research has indeed shed light on the complex relationship between REM sleep and dreaming. The double dissociation I identified—where individuals can dream without REM sleep and experience REM sleep without dreaming—has significant implications for understanding these phenomena.

While REM sleep is correlated with dreaming, the two are not identical. I posited that the mechanisms driving dreaming are distinct from those governing REM sleep, particularly highlighting the role of the mesocortical dopaminergic system in facilitating the dream state.

Recent studies have explored the function of dreaming, suggesting that it may serve as a virtual reality in which individuals can navigate their motivated states without engaging in real-world actions that may be incompatible with sleep. This hypothesis posits that dreaming allows individuals to process their experiences and emotions in a safe, albeit hallucinatory, environment.

As we continue to investigate the mechanisms underlying dreaming, I am optimistic that future research will yield further insights into its biological function and significance. 

Thank you, Mark, for your illuminating discussion on these multifaceted topics. I look forward to seeing your ongoing research in both consciousness and dreaming.
