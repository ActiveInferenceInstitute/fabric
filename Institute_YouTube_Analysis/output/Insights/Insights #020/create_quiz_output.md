Subject: Active Inference and Agency

* Learning objective: Understanding the philosophical underpinnings of the Free Energy Principle and its implications for agency and autonomy in living systems.
    - Question 1: How does the Free Energy Principle challenge traditional notions of agency, and what implications does this have for understanding purposiveness in living systems?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Discuss the role of metabolic processes in establishing a realist account of autonomy as proposed in Kate Nave's research. How does this differ from purely mathematical interpretations?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: In what ways can the concept of agency be seen as a continuum rather than a binary state, according to the discussions surrounding active inference?
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Analyzing the relationship between predictive processing and visual phenomenology in the context of agency.
    - Question 1: How does predictive processing provide a framework for understanding visual experience in relation to action, and what are its limitations?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Critically assess the claim that perception is fundamentally action-oriented. How does this perspective influence our understanding of visual phenomenology?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: Explore the implications of the intermediate level processing model in predictive coding theories. How does it relate to the subjective experience of agency?
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Evaluating the implications of agency and autonomy for understanding the self in living systems.
    - Question 1: Discuss the distinction between the 'I' and 'me' in the context of self-referential models of agency. How does this distinction impact our understanding of self-consciousness?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: How can the concept of a dynamic self be reconciled with the principles of active inference? What challenges arise in maintaining a coherent identity over time?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: Analyze the role of affect in the formation of a pre-reflective self-awareness. How does this contribute to our understanding of agency in living systems?
    - Answer 3:
