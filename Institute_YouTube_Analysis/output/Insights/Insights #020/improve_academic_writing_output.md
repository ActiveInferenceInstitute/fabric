**Refined Text:**

Welcome back to Active Inference Insights. I am your host, Darus PvZ Wayne, and today I am delighted to have a conversation with Kate Nave. Kate is an early career research fellow at the University of Edinburgh, where her research aims to develop a realist understanding of autonomy and agency, grounded in the metabolic nature of living systems. She has recently completed a book titled *A Drive to Survive: The Free Energy Principle and the Meaning of Life*, which the active inference community eagerly anticipates. Kate, welcome to the show, and thank you for joining us; I hope this discussion will be enjoyable.

Thank you for having me; itâ€™s nice to meet you.

As you know, there are several books on active inference, but they tend to be quite technical and textbook-like. I am curious about how the idea for your book emerged and what the writing process was like for you.

Certainly. The writing process was quite a journey that began during my PhD. Initially, I focused on predictive processing and visual phenomenology through the lens of Hegelian phenomenology, attempting to connect those ideas to predictive processing. This exploration eventually led me deeper into the free energy principle. I initially believed that the free energy principle would effectively expand active accounts of purpose and intentionality. However, as I investigated further, I found that my book emerged from two primary goals. 

First, I sought to articulate the philosophical aspects of the free energy principle in a manner that remains accessible, avoiding excessive reliance on formalism. At the time of writing, mathematical communication regarding the principle had improved significantly, making it more understandable for individuals with mathematical training. Nonetheless, those without such a background still lacked accessible resources. Thus, the first half of the book aims to elucidate the formal aspects of the principle in an intuitive, non-mathematical manner. 

Second, as I deconstructed the mathematical implications, it became evident to me that the elements intended to explain purposiveness and agency were not adequately addressed. This observation, though perhaps more accepted today, was less common during my research. Additionally, I discovered fascinating work on the physics of living systems, which revealed their inherent complexity and the challenges associated with defining them. The free energy principle serves as a useful entry point for exploring this research, as it challenges the limits of mathematical formalism in describing living systems. The conclusion of the book highlights that there is much beyond the free energy principle that cannot be captured by its elegant simplicity.

I am particularly interested in your discussion of agency and its evolving perception, especially within the context of active inference. The framework might intuitively suggest a realist perspective on agency, embedded in the concept of self-evidence. This notion traces back to early ideas of autopoiesis, suggesting that organisms actively assert their existence and carve out their own niche. When you state that agency is not fully represented, do you mean that it is an illusion we create for ourselves to navigate the world, or that it cannot be adequately explained through the formalism of active inference?

I contend that the active inference framework does not allow us to describe the underlying reality that accounts for purposiveness. This raises the question of whether this shift in perspective is due to the limitations of the framework or if it suggests a more profound misunderstanding of agency itself. Currently, there is a growing body of literature that presents the purposive interpretation of active inference as instrumental, suggesting that it is useful for describing certain systems but not others. Ultimately, it is important to recognize that the processes involved are primarily focused on energy minimization, with the application of intentionality being a mere gloss that highlights a difference in degree rather than a difference in kind.

Does this perspective rest on a fundamental assumption that agency and purposiveness are intrinsic to living systems? If so, how can we ground this starting point? Is it merely phenomenological, or is there a more substantial basis for differentiating between a living organism and a non-living object, such as a rock?

Yes, that is indeed part of my argument. I have not explored this issue as deeply in my book as I would like, but I began with the presupposition of an inactive view of purposiveness and agency. My work on visual experience has led me to recognize that phenomenological accounts often depict perception as inherently purposive and intentional. I believe that our understanding of cognition fundamentally relies on agency; if we disregard this concept, the entire framework begins to unravel. Critics often attempt to uphold an instrumentalist stance, but I find this problematic. For instance, discussions of agency often relate to our interests, which complicates our understanding of the very interests we seek to clarify. This recursive challenge typically halts at evolutionary explanations.

If agency is intrinsic to living systems, does this imply that we lose significant aspects of our understanding if we deny it? The philosopher Jerry Fodor has argued that without agency, we risk losing essential concepts such as function, which are critical for distinguishing between different systems. If we view agency merely as a useful illusion, we may overlook its deeper implications for understanding living systems.

As we explore the relationship between agency and free will, do you believe that your perspective is contingent upon the existence of free will, or does it exist independently of that framework? 

I think it is crucial to differentiate between the notion of function as a guiding principle of living systems and the concept of free will. I argue that certain systems possess needs and are engaged in actions that can be evaluated as better or worse for their survival, independent of human interpretations of free will. I adopt an anti-realist stance, suggesting that there are real facts about what living systems require to thrive. While I recognize that the concept of free will is often debated and difficult to define, my focus is primarily on the needs that shape behavior and the responsibilities we can attribute to living systems without necessarily invoking free will.

Your emphasis on the role of constraints in active inference brings to mind the distinction between causality and constraints. How do you understand this difference, and what implications does it have for our philosophical outlook?

While I have not delved deeply into the metaphysics of causation, I find the concept of constraints particularly illuminating. Constraints can be viewed as a type of cause that effectively describes living systems. They articulate the dependence of systems on external inputs, which is crucial for understanding how living systems maintain stability and function. In contrast, traditional notions of causation often lead to confusion, making it challenging to identify clear causal relationships. By focusing on constraints, we can better articulate the unique characteristics of living systems, as they depend on external factors while simultaneously embodying an internal structure that governs their behavior.

How does this understanding of constraints fit into the framework of active inference, especially in relation to hidden or latent causes?

In active inference, there is often a conflation between statistical and causal concepts. While it is essential to acknowledge this conflation, we can explore the relationship between statistical causation and the framework of active inference. Some philosophers advocate for a statistical reduction of causation, suggesting that events can be understood in terms of statistical relationships rather than traditional causal chains. This perspective could provide valuable insights into the active inference approach and help delineate the distinctions between different types of causes and their implications for understanding living systems.

Returning to the topic of perception, you highlight the interplay between perception and action, emphasizing that perception often serves as a guide for action. What are your thoughts on how this interplay shapes our understanding of consciousness?

I believe that perception is intrinsically linked to action; we perceive objects in terms of their actionable possibilities. However, when considering altered states of consciousness, such as those induced by meditation or psychedelics, the relationship between perception and action becomes less clear. In these states, the perception of objects may be altered, and the actionable possibilities may not be as evident. This raises intriguing questions about the nature of perception and its relationship to consciousness. 

In conclusion, our discussion has traversed a wide range of topics, including agency, constraints, and the nature of perception. Your insights have illuminated various aspects of these complex concepts, and I appreciate your willingness to engage in this thought-provoking dialogue. 

Thank you for having me. I enjoyed our conversation and look forward to further exploring these ideas.
