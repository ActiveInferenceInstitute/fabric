**Title:** Vulnerability to Reflected XSS on /renderHTML Endpoint Leading to Potential Account Takeover

## Summary:
The `/renderHTML` endpoint on the site.com domain is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via the `HTMLCode` query parameter. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive data, including authentication tokens stored in LocalStorage.

## Description:
The vulnerability is present in the `HTMLCode` parameter of the `/renderHTML` endpoint. When a user sends a request with a crafted payload, such as `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`, the server reflects this input directly into the response without adequate sanitization. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser.

For example, the request:
```
GET /renderHTML?HTMLCode=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
Host: site.com
```
results in a response that includes:
```
<html>Here is your code: <script>alert(document.domain)</script></html>
```
This reflected script runs in the context of the victimâ€™s browser, enabling the attacker to manipulate the DOM or steal sensitive information, such as the `access_token` from LocalStorage.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Log in to the application to ensure that the `access_token` is stored in LocalStorage.
2. In your browser, navigate to the following URL:
   ```
   https://site.com/renderHTML?HTMLCode=<script>alert(localStorage.getItem("access_token"))</script>
   ```
3. Observe the alert that displays the `access_token`, demonstrating successful exfiltration of sensitive information.

## Supporting Material/References:

## Impact:
This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser under the site.com origin. By exploiting the reflected XSS, attackers can potentially hijack user sessions by stealing authentication tokens, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information. This poses a significant risk to user privacy and application integrity, warranting immediate remediation.
