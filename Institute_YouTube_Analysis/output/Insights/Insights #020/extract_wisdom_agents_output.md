SUMMARY
- Darus PvZ Wayne interviews Kate Nave about her research on autonomy, agency, and her book on the free energy principle.

IDEAS:
- Kate Nave explores the relationship between autonomy, agency, and the free energy principle.
- The book aims to make complex philosophical ideas accessible without relying heavily on mathematics.
- The free energy principle is viewed as a useful framework for understanding living systems.
- There is a distinction between purposiveness as an instrumental tool versus intrinsic agency.
- Living systems are seen as fundamentally different from non-living systems, challenging simplistic views.
- The concept of agency may be an illusion rather than a logical necessity in some interpretations.
- The need for self-constitution plays a significant role in individual identity and social coherence.
- The dynamism of living systems introduces unpredictability, complicating simplistic causal models.
- Intermediate level processing highlights how perception and action are intertwined in understanding experience.
- The experience of agency and purposiveness is tied to biological and psychological needs.
- Perception is influenced by action possibilities, shaping how we interpret the world around us.
- The relationship between needs and perception is complex, with deeper needs often shaping surface-level desires.
- Self-awareness evolves from basic needs to complex identity construction over time.
- The concept of affordances in perception emphasizes the practical implications of our experiences.
- Phenomenological approaches to consciousness can offer insights into subjective experiences beyond mere reflection.
- The interplay between individual and collective needs shapes the dynamics of social structures.
- Perception may bottom out at actionable levels, reflecting our capabilities and limitations as organisms.
- The philosophical implications of agency and selfhood raise questions about the nature of consciousness.
- The free energy principle may serve as a useful framework but does not fully explain the richness of lived experience.
- Future research may explore the implications of psychedelics on perception and action in novel ways.

INSIGHTS:
- The autonomy of living systems is deeply connected to their metabolic needs and processes.
- The distinction between agency and purposiveness challenges traditional philosophical views on free will.
- Understanding agency requires acknowledging the complexity of living systems beyond mathematical formalism.
- Perception serves as a guide for action, shaped by an individual's biological and psychological needs.
- The relationship between action and perception emphasizes the importance of context in understanding experience.
- The evolving nature of identity reflects the ongoing process of self-constitution within social frameworks.
- The unpredictability of living systems suggests a more nuanced understanding of causality and agency.
- Acknowledging the limitations of the free energy principle invites exploration of alternative explanations for consciousness.
- The phenomenology of perception is influenced by deeper needs, shaping our experience of reality.
- The dynamic interplay between individual and collective identities highlights the significance of social cohesion.
- The notion of minimal phenomenality raises questions about the essence of subjective experience.
- The need for coherence in identity is fundamental for social interaction and personal fulfillment.
- The role of higher-order mental states in consciousness invites further investigation into self-awareness.
- Understanding the nature of perception may reveal insights into the boundaries of consciousness.
- The exploration of affordances in perception provides a framework for understanding human experience.
- The implications of agency and selfhood extend beyond individual experience to encompass broader philosophical inquiries.

QUOTES:
- "The book came out of this to do two things for me."
- "It’s at the point which I was writing it was well pretty well commun."
- "What are the formal aspects of the principle actually saying in a way that’s explained non-mathematically?"
- "I think the kind of aspects that were supposed to account for purposiveness and agency weren’t really there."
- "If you can’t everything we want to say about cognition for me is grounded in agency."
- "When we’re talking about talk of agency purpose is being relative to like our interests."
- "The idea is the way in which that gives you this kind of need that is your own need."
- "I think you can have events at a level small enough so they could be genuinely random."
- "The idea of constraint causation gets across is that dependence on exteriority."
- "You can have very general invariants but those general invariants don’t allow you to pick out individuals."
- "There’s this gorgeous photo actually like I love Jry photo and he’s obviously very known for his defense of intentionality."
- "You need the input of energy to be channeled by the constraint."
- "The idea of self constraint seems like a self-defeating idea."
- "There’s always talk physically there’s very sort of striving notion of perception."
- "What you have is a system where there are needs intrinsic to that network."
- "Perception is for action, action is also for perception."
- "If you have more than one middle level like is it you know how does that actually shift with action?"
- "Every living system has this like basic striving and need."
- "The basic sense of self is like misalignment or misachievement that we’re trying to align."
- "The sense of self being very different from the way active inference necessarily does."
- "There’s a sense in which it can change and there’s a sense in which it can’t change."
