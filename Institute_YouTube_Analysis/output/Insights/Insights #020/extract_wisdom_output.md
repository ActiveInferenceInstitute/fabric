# SUMMARY
Darus PvZ Wayne interviews Kate Nave, a research fellow, discussing her book on the free energy principle and agency in living systems.

# IDEAS:
- Kate Nave's book aims to explain the free energy principle's philosophical implications without heavy formalism.
- The book's first half demystifies complex mathematical ideas for broader accessibility to non-experts.
- A lack of clarity in the free energy principle's account of agency and purposiveness is discussed.
- Living systems exhibit intricate behaviors beyond simple models, challenging traditional biological assumptions.
- Agency and purposiveness in living systems may be more complex than active inference suggests.
- The importance of distinguishing between different kinds of agency in living and non-living systems is emphasized.
- Active inference may not sufficiently account for the inherent purposiveness of living systems.
- Philosophical ideas around agency are evolving, reflecting a broader understanding of living systems.
- There’s a growing recognition that agency is a difference in kind, not just in degree.
- The philosophical implications of agency and autonomy are crucial for understanding cognition.
- The concept of self-evidencing in organisms is explored through the lens of agency.
- The relationship between constraints and causation is a key theme in understanding living systems.
- Constraints can be seen as a type of cause that helps explain living systems’ behavior.
- The notion of operational closure in living systems distinguishes them from non-living entities.
- Distinctions between internal and external constraints are debated in the context of agency.
- The book’s exploration of biological autonomy could reshape our understanding of life’s purpose.
- The concept of agency is tied to the ability to self-constitute and self-regulate.
- A deeper understanding of agency may require rethinking traditional metaphysical assumptions.
- The significance of phenomenology in understanding perception and action is discussed.
- The interplay between perception and action is crucial for understanding cognitive processes.
- The relationship between needs and agency highlights the complexity of living systems’ behaviors.

# INSIGHTS:
- The free energy principle provides a useful framework, but it may oversimplify agency in living systems.
- Agency cannot be fully captured by mathematical models; a richer understanding is needed.
- Living systems demonstrate a unique kind of purposiveness that active inference does not adequately address.
- The complexity of agency in living organisms demands a more nuanced philosophical exploration.
- Understanding agency requires distinguishing between different levels of complexity in living systems.
- The debate on constraints and causation can inform a more robust understanding of living systems.
- Perception and action are intricately linked, revealing deeper insights into cognitive processes.
- The exploration of agency may reshape our understanding of human cognition and identity.
- Agency in living systems is about more than just survival; it encompasses self-constitution and purpose.
- The concept of self may be more fluid than previously thought, reflecting the dynamic nature of life.
