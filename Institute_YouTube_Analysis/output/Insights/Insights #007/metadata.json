  "description": "In 2021, Raja et al. published \u2018The Markov Blanket Trick\u2019, which argued that \u201cthe FEP [Free Energy Principle] is not the general principle it is claimed to be, and that active inference is not the all-encompassing process theory it is purported to be either.\u201d This led to a flurry of responses from within the active inference community, with commentaries published by Friston, Ramstead and Albarracin & Pitliya, amongst others. In this episode of Active Inference Insights, we unpick this controversial paper with the help of its primary author, Vicente Raja, and Jeff Beck, a computational neuroscientist studying probabilistic reasoning in humans and animals. \n\nVicente Raja\nhttps://www.rotman.uwo.ca/portfolio-items/raja-vicente/\nhttps://twitter.com/DioVicen\n\nJeff Beck\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-beck-6b5085196\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
