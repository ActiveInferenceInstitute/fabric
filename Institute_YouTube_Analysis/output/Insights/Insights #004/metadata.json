  "description": "In this fourth episode of Active Inference Insights, Darius and In\u00eas Hip\u00f3lito delve into the murky waters of Markov blankets, exploring whether they are real or just an instrumental tool, how they impact on The Modularity of Mind theory, as well as the true meanings of \u201cactive\u201d and \u201csensory\u201d states. In addition to this, In\u00eas presents a thorough account of the historical transition from computational to enactivist theories of cognition, before she and Darius try and shed light on the role of consciousness and representations in a mind that is putatively embodied, embedded, enactive and extended beyond the brain.\n\nIn\u00eas Hip\u00f3lito \nhttps://ineshipolito.my.canva.site/\nhttps://twitter.com/ineshipolito?\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WXSE96YAAAAJ&hl=en\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
