  "description": "In this episode of Active Inference Insights, we welcome our first mathematician onto the show: Lance Da Costa. If you\u2019re into Langevins, Fokker-Plancks, solenoidals and Fisher information metric tensors, this one is for you. However, if all that terrifies you to high heaven, don\u2019t fret; Lance and Darius also explore eco-niche modelling, temporality, metacognition and far more in this deep dive into cutting-edge Active Inference theory. \n\nLance Da Costa\nhttps://www.lancelotdacosta.com\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PCHqHCsAAAAJ&hl=en\nhttps://twitter.com/lancelotdacosta?lang=en\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Darius-Parvizi-Wayne\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
