Refined Text:

It is July 8, 2024, and we welcome you to Active Inference Insights, episode number 24, which serves as both a season finale and a pivotal transition point. Darius, how are you today?

I am doing well, thank you. I apologize to everyone for my headband; I am currently in El Salvador, where it is quite warm, and my hair is rather unruly, so I decided to tie it back. In any case, I am well. How are you, Daniel?

I am also well. As we discussed briefly, this episode will reflect on the inception and journey of the Insight series, encompassing episodes 1 through 23, and we will explore what lies ahead for insights and for you personally. Let us begin with the origins of Insights. How did it come to be, and what were the initial steps like?

Firstly, it is somewhat disappointing that we did not reach episode 25; a round number would have been preferable, but 24 will suffice. The conception of this series emerged from a perceived gap in the offerings of the Institute, particularly regarding live streams, which tend to be quite technical and may not provide accessible entry points for understanding how active inference integrates with various theories in biology, neuroscience, and philosophy. There was a need for a format that allowed individuals to learn alongside me, which I believe is an effective approach to podcasting.

My journey began during my master's program at University College London (UCL) from 2022 to 2023. I discovered active inference through the lens of predictive processing, particularly since Carl Friston is affiliated with UCL and active inference is a significant focus there. I began attending Discord discussions, as recommended by Miles Taft, my supervisor at UCL, who is also interested in active inference. After some time, I reached out to you in September or October, and everything came together rather quickly. 

I owe a great deal to Carl, who was our first guest. Engaging in a three-hour discussion with him was nerve-wracking but ultimately rewarding. Since then, the series has evolved significantly. Based on viewership metrics, the most popular episodes have featured Chris Fields discussing physics and information processing, as well as your series. 

When we host a guest stream that can become technical, or when we focus on a specific paper, it often resembles a conversation with literature rather than an interactive dialogue. In contrast, Chris Fields' course-like format established a professor-student dynamic, while our discussions have fostered a more personal connection. This human element is reminiscent of a textbook group, albeit without the constraints of a textbook as a reference point, allowing for a broader exploration of topics.

I have always aspired to conduct in-person episodes, as I believe that situating discussions in a physical context enhances engagement. The Institute's unique geographical positioning, as a distributed entity, is remarkable; it unites individuals from diverse backgrounds with a shared interest in this framework. Throughout this series, I aimed to cultivate mutual insights through dialogue, acknowledging the inherent challenges of achieving this through monologue.

Reflecting on our conversations, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and engagement of all participants. For instance, John Vervaeke, a significant influence on my intellectual journey, left a profound impression during our discussion. Additionally, I appreciated integrating perspectives from individuals outside of active inference, as their insights contributed to our understanding of the framework's evolution. Engaging with critics, such as those who have previously expressed skepticism towards active inference, is essential for fostering a dynamic discourse.

Several recurring themes emerged throughout the series, particularly the relationship between the mathematical foundations of active inference and lived experiences. A central question revolved around how mathematical models relate to human behavior and cognition, which was a significant point of discussion among participants. The exploration of consciousness and its implications for lived experience also became a focal point, given my research interests.

As I prepare to begin my PhD in October at Macquarie University in Sydney, I am eager to explore concepts of subjectivity and the nature of self. My previous work on flow states, alongside collaborators, highlighted the complexities of self-referential constructs in active inference. I am particularly interested in the intersection of phenomenology and cognitive science, examining how subjective experiences inform our understanding of agency and selfhood.

I am enthusiastic about the future of the Insights series and the potential for continued engagement with a diverse array of voices. As we move forward, it is imperative to remain open to dialogue and to recognize the multifaceted nature of knowledge production within the active inference community.

Thank you, Darius, for your insights and contributions to this series. I look forward to seeing how the conversations evolve in the future.
