  "description": "With all the current excitement around the prospect of artificial general intelligence, it is easy to forget that there already exist exemplars of problem-solving and creativity all around us - namely, ourselves. With this in mind, join Darius and computer scientist Alexander Ororbia for a discussion of biomimicry and mortal computation, which centres on the viability of building artificial systems modelled on the evolved, intelligent life forms on this planet.\n\nAlexander Ororbia\nhttps://www.rit.edu/directory/agovcs-alexander-ororbia\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09589.pdf MORTAL COMPUTATION: A FOUNDATION FOR BIOMIMETIC INTELLIGENCE\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09257.pdf BRAIN-INSPIRED MACHINE INTELLIGENCE: A SURVEY OF NEUROBIOLOGICALLY-PLAUSIBLE CREDIT ASSIGNMENT\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07870.pdf BRAIN-INSPIRED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE VIA PREDICTIVE CODING\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Darius-Parvizi-Wayne\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
