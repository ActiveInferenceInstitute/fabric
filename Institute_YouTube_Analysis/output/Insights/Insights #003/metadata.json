  "description": "The Active Inference Institute is absolutely thrilled to bring you this third episode of Active Inference Insights with our host, Darius Parvizi-Wayne, and his esteemed guest, John Vervaeke. John is a cognitive scientist at the University of Toronto and is a leading intellectual in the fields of intelligence, rationality and meaning in life. He is also the host of the extremely popular lecture series, Awakening From The Meaning Crisis, as well as After Socrates. In this episode, John and Darius work through the convergence points of relevance realisation and predictive processing, before moving onto the function of consciousness, flow states, the implications of radical enactivism, and much, much more.\n\nJohn Vervaeke\nhttps://johnvervaeke.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/vervaeke_john?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/johnvervaeke\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51wcY39ouGs&t=1155s\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
