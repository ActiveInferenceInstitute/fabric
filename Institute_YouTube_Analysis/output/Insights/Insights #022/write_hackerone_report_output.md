**Title:** Insufficient Input Validation in User Registration Leads to SQL Injection Vulnerability

## Summary:
An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the user registration endpoint of the application due to insufficient input validation on the `username` and `password` parameters. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially compromising the entire database.

## Description:
The vulnerability is located in the user registration endpoint at `/api/register`. When a user submits a registration form, the application processes the `username` and `password` fields without properly sanitizing or validating the input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into these parameters.

For example, an attacker could submit the following payload:
```
username=admin'; -- 
password=any_password
```
This input, when processed by the server, could manipulate the SQL query to bypass authentication or insert malicious data into the database.

The lack of prepared statements or parameterized queries exacerbates this issue, as the application directly concatenates user input into SQL queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, and even administrative privileges.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the user registration page at `https://example.com/api/register`.
2. Enter the following values into the registration fields:
   - `username`: `admin'; -- `
   - `password`: `any_password`
3. Submit the registration form.
4. Observe that the application processes the request without error, and the attacker can manipulate the database.

## Impact:
Exploitation of this SQL Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database. This could lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even complete database compromise. Given the potential access to sensitive user information, this vulnerability poses a severe risk to the application and its users, warranting immediate attention and remediation.
