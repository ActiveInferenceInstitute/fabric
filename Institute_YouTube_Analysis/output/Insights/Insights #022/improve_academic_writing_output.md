**Refined Text:**

Greetings everyone, and welcome back to the show. Today, I am exceedingly pleased to be speaking with Chris Deler. Chris is a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Research in Cognition and Neurosciences in Brussels. His research primarily focuses on computational models of cognitive functions, mental representations, and consciousness, as well as broader topics of significance in the philosophy of computation, the philosophy and ethics of AI, metacognition, and the philosophy of science. Chris, thank you very much for joining me.

Thank you for the invitation; it is an absolute pleasure. People have been requesting a critical examination of active inference, and you are the ideal person for this discussion. However, before we delve into that, I would like to mention that we briefly discussed Dan Dennett off-air. Unfortunately, Dan passed away last week, and I believe he was your PhD supervisor. Clearly, a substantial portion of your work has been influenced by him. I wanted to talk about your 2015 paper, which discusses the Cartesian theater and its place—or lack thereof—in predictive processing. But before we proceed to that, I know you would like to share some thoughts about Dan and discuss his broader influence on you.

Certainly, thank you. This is a profoundly sad moment because Dan has, in many ways, defined the landscape of philosophy of mind from the 20th century to the present, and his passing is a significant loss. As I mentioned when we were arranging this meeting, I would like to spend some time discussing him. Dan is a philosopher whose approach to the philosophy of mind should be emulated. It is worth emphasizing that this is one of the many interesting and important aspects of his work. Additionally, I had a personal relationship with him; I completed two extended research stays with him during my PhD and met him on numerous occasions at various conferences. Over the past weekend, many obituaries were published about Dan, illustrating the vast influence he had across multiple disciplines. It is astonishing to see how many people he inspired. It is also important to remember that he was an exceptionally kind person—truly a joy to be around. 

This kindness is something I often feel is lacking in contemporary philosophy. Dan focused heavily on science, believing that there is no philosophy that is free from scientific influence. He maintained that the philosophy of mind should be informed by our best scientific knowledge. Sometimes, it seems philosophers forget this, becoming insular within their discipline and failing to look beyond the confines of the ivory tower of philosophy of mind. It is crucial to remember that Dan's legacy is that philosophy can and should be informed by science; this engagement is both productive and vital for philosophers. 

Moreover, philosophers can often take themselves too seriously, becoming entrenched in their positions and overly competitive. While Dan was undeniably a flamboyant personality, he was remarkably kind to junior scholars and always found time to engage with younger researchers and students. He was genuinely curious about what others thought of his work, even when it was critical. Importantly, he did not take himself too seriously; he believed that philosophy should be an intellectual adventure rather than a dogmatic crusade. 

I don’t know if you would like to ask anything else about Dan.

Yes, I would like to echo everything you just mentioned. Although I never met Dan, I recognize that I am not currently in a position in my career where that would have been feasible. I completed my schooling in 2017, but even while studying philosophy, Dan's name was pervasive. He was a figure not only in the philosophy of mind but also in broader discussions of epistemology and ontology. His influence was so significant that he felt like a grandfather of modern philosophy to me, despite never having met him. 

You are absolutely right; the outpouring of tributes on social media over the weekend was remarkable. It was evident that he touched many lives, both as a person and as an intellectual. 

I am curious, what was Dan like during your PhD? What was he like as a guide and mentor?

Dan was incredibly kind and very encouraging. He was eager to learn, which I heard from others who had post-doctoral positions with him or were his PhD students. When someone approached him with expertise in an area he was not familiar with, he was genuinely interested in learning from them. During my dissertation, which focused on predictive processing, he was very curious about the models and engaged in discussions about various modeling algorithms. 

What was particularly special about him as an academic mentor was his well-roundedness. Today, academia tends to favor narrow specialization, and many scholars forget that Dan was skilled in various domains. His curiosity allowed him to draw connections between different fields of work. He frequently suggested readings that might seem unrelated to your specific topic but ultimately revealed connections that enriched your understanding. He was a joy to be around, even though he was busy. Despite his many commitments, he was generous with his time. 

One of the best pieces of advice he gave me occurred while I was writing a paper. Midway through my work, another author published a paper that was strikingly similar to mine. I felt disheartened and approached Dan, expressing my frustration about the situation. He advised me that philosophers arguing about who originated an idea first are akin to sailors arguing over who first noticed a change in the wind. This perspective was invaluable; it reminded me that our motivation for engaging in philosophy should not stem from a desire to be recognized as the sole authority but rather from our appreciation for exploring complex problems collaboratively. 

Despite his stature, Dan consistently resisted the notion of a singular genius in philosophy. He believed that ideas emerge under the right conditions, and he often referred to standing on the shoulders of giants. 

This notion resonates with Carl Jung's assertion that ideas possess individuals rather than the reverse. It is remarkably similar to some of Dan's ideas, particularly in his work discussing memes. I had the privilege of engaging with Dan while he was finishing his book, "From Bacteria to Bach and Back," and our discussions highlighted his awareness of how ideas are interconnected across disciplines. 

I want to emphasize that Dan's writing style was engaging and accessible, in contrast to much of contemporary philosophy, which can be tedious. His ability to discuss complex topics in an engaging manner is a skill that many could learn from. 

I completely agree with you; he had a unique voice as a writer that mirrored the way he communicated in conversation. Interestingly, this style was not universally accepted when he first published. For instance, his first book, "Content and Consciousness," received mixed reviews due to its writing style, which was seen as unconventional at the time. 

There has certainly been a shift in reception, as his writing gained appreciation, especially in his later years. However, I wonder whether we have an obligation to present our ideas clearly, even if our work is published in philosophy journals. We must avoid speaking solely to ourselves and remain accessible. Dan epitomized this clarity, demonstrating that it is possible to engage readers while conveying intricate ideas. 

This highlights a broader issue; many philosophers have their unique styles, which is commendable. It is fitting that we discuss this on this podcast. I have been criticized for my writing style, sometimes described as reminiscent of Friston's work, particularly in my use of the term "evince." This has become a sort of marker, indicating my influences. 

Moving on to your 2015 paper, "The Curtain Call for the Cartesian Theater," I revisited it in preparation for our conversation. I was struck by your critique of the Cartesian theater and its relevance to predictive processing. For readers unfamiliar with the paper, could you explain Cartesian materialism and its implications for predictive processing? What are its shortcomings? 

Certainly. The paper was co-authored with my colleague Joe, with whom I studied in Edinburgh before starting my PhD. We encountered predictive processing through a seminar where we read a draft of Andy Clark's "Surfing Uncertainty." Our paper was a response to a publication by Carl Friston and Hobson, who invoked the Cartesian theater concept. 

Cartesian materialism, a term coined by Dan Dennett, describes a perspective on consciousness that he viewed as a remnant of Descartes' ideas. It posits that there exists a specific point in the brain where information must arrive to be rendered conscious. For Descartes, this was the pineal gland, thought to mediate between the mechanistic mind and the soul. 

Dennett criticized this view, arguing that it necessitates a form of double transduction. Sensory information is first transduced into neuronal spikes and then must undergo another transduction to be rendered conscious. He described this second product as a "figment," analogous to "pigment," suggesting that additional properties must be applied to information for it to be experienced consciously. 

Anti-reductionists assert that phenomenal properties cannot be reduced to functional properties. Thus, we are left with the question of where in the brain this "figment" is applied. Dennett's position was that there is no singular location in the brain where this transduction occurs; rather, it is a collection of functions that must work together to create consciousness. 

This raises an interesting counterargument: while the Cartesian theater may be criticized, one could argue that there remains a necessity for some form of transduction from sensory input to conscious experience. Even if we adopt a distributed perspective of the brain, it seems there must be a moment when sensory information enters a conscious realm. Would Dennett or you have reservations about this weaker interpretation of Cartesian materialism? 

That is a compelling question. I believe Dennett would indeed have concerns regarding that interpretation. He explicitly sought to move away from the metaphor of a screen or any notion of special properties in consciousness. Many contemporary critiques label him as an eliminativist about consciousness, but he was adamant that he did not belong to that camp. Dennett believed that there is indeed a subjective perspective that differentiates our experiences, and he did not wish to deny this. 

He and Keith Frankish coined the term "illusionism" to encourage a shift in how we discuss phenomenal properties. They advocated for a move away from viewing these properties as needing a place in our ontology. I think he would reject the assertion that there is a singular conscious system; rather, he would argue that various cognitive functions are necessary for consciousness. 

While I appreciate the multiple drafts model, I am less certain about its applicability. Much of the current work in consciousness science focuses on higher-order systems and the distinctions between lower and higher-order processing. I am increasingly leaning toward a higher-order theory of mind, suggesting that certain processes or systems may be privileged in facilitating consciousness. 

This is an intriguing development. I have been exploring higher-order theories of consciousness, particularly concerning self-awareness. The distinction between pre-reflective states of self-awareness and higher-order states raises questions about their relationship. How do you reconcile these otherwise seemingly irreducible and intrinsic features of consciousness? 

That is a profound question. I am not fully immersed in the literature on pre-reflective self-consciousness, but I am becoming more acquainted with it. My current research is focused on affective experiences, and some theorists argue that emotional experiences necessitate an explicit involvement of the self. For instance, Joul would claim that one cannot feel fear unless they recognize that something is dangerous to them. 

I am aware of the literature on minimal phenomenal experiences, which Thomas Metzinger has recently explored. This work investigates the possibility of experiencing pure phenomenology during deep meditative states. I acknowledge that both minimal pre-reflective experiences and minimal phenomenal states challenge higher-order theories. 

Higher-order theorists might argue that these experiences are not conscious because they are not explicitly reflected upon. The challenge arises when we question the nature of these higher-order states. How do we justify their existence without them being conscious themselves? 

This brings us to the question of how we perceive these phenomenal textures, traditionally referred to as qualia. Even if I do not need to reflect on the taste of coffee to experience it, there seems to be a dimension of experience that is intrinsic to consciousness. 

One approach is to consider the idea of a Bayesian framework, where the notion of fame in the brain intersects with predictive processing. If we take Dennett's multiple drafts model seriously, it aligns with the concept of running multiple hypotheses regarding our sensory data. However, one must consider that in principle, no hypothesis can achieve absolute certainty. This raises questions about how we arrive at a singular, coherent conscious perception despite the probabilistic nature of our experiences. 

This is an excellent inquiry. I approach the Bayesian brain hypothesis from an anti-realist perspective. My stance is that all models are inherently flawed; some are useful, while others may be misleading. The challenge lies in determining how to model processes in a way that captures the intricacies of consciousness. 

When modeling the Bayesian brain, one must decide how to approximate the processes at play. It is unlikely that the brain operates under exact Bayesian inference; rather, it employs methods of approximation. For example, Carl and others propose variational Bayesian inference, while others might favor sampling methods. 

If one adopts a sampling-based model, the indeterminacy problem may be mitigated because sampling implies that one is experiencing a determinate point from a probabilistic distribution. Another possibility is to consider a dual coding hypothesis, where different levels of the predictive hierarchy operate on continuous and discrete spaces. 

However, we must acknowledge that there appears to be more variability in our perceptual experiences than can be accounted for by a singular model. This raises questions about how we can reconcile these varying perspectives while maintaining a coherent understanding of consciousness. 

I recognize that these discussions are deeply rooted philosophical problems that may not be easily resolved in a single conversation. An interesting avenue for exploration is the role of time in our perceptual experiences. When we consider how experience unfolds over time, it becomes clear that our conscious experience is not static. 

To illustrate this point, we can consider how actions are inherently determinate. Each action has a specific outcome, and our conscious experience must reflect this determinacy. This leads to the question of how we can reconcile our understanding of perceptual experience with the probabilistic nature of our predictions. 

I appreciate your insights and the depth of our discussion. It is evident that we are navigating complex philosophical questions that may require further exploration. Thank you for your thoughtful engagement, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue in the future.
