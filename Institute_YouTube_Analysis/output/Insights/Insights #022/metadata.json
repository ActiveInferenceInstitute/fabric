  "description": "In the 22nd episode of Active Inference Insights, philosopher of mind and cognitive scientist Krys Dolega and Darius discuss the life and work of the late, great Daniel Dennett, before moving onto the role of attention in our mental lives and its relationship to phenomenal experience. In the final part of this podcast, Krys and Darius unpick the somewhat controversial The Emperor\u2019s New Markov Blankets paper, focussing on the extent to which the free energy principle and active inference can provide deep insights into the nature of reality.\n\nKrys Dolega\nhttps://twitter.com/krysdolega?lang=en\nhttps://www.krysdolega.xyz\nhttps://tf-ap.com/program/\nhttps://assc27.net/\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahuMDH4AAAAJ&hl=en\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
