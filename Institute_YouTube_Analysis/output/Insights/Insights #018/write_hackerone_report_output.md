**Title:** Vulnerability in Active Inference Framework Allows Unauthorized Data Access

## Summary:
A vulnerability exists within the active inference framework that allows unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to exposure of confidential information. This could be exploited through manipulated inputs, affecting the integrity of the inference process.

## Description:
The active inference framework relies on probabilistic models to predict and respond to environmental stimuli. However, certain inputs to these models are insufficiently validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary data. For example, if the model accepts user input for state priors without adequate sanitization, an attacker could exploit this to introduce malicious data.

This vulnerability lies in the handling of user-provided data that influences the active inference process. If an attacker can manipulate the inputs (e.g., by providing unexpected values), they could alter the behavior of the model, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or unintended actions by the system.

Exploiting this vulnerability does not require advanced technical skills; an attacker could achieve this by crafting specific requests that manipulate the model's expectations. The impact of such an exploit could range from unauthorized data exposure to significant disruptions in the operational integrity of the system.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Set up an instance of the active inference framework where user inputs are accepted for state priors.
2. Craft a malicious input that deviates from expected data formats or values (e.g., inputting a non-numeric value where a numeric value is expected).
3. Submit the crafted input and observe how the framework processes this input. Check for any unauthorized data access or unexpected changes in system behavior.

## Impact:
The implications of this vulnerability are severe. An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulate the active inference process, and potentially disrupt the system's functionality. This poses significant risks to data integrity, confidentiality, and the overall trustworthiness of the active inference framework. Ensuring robust input validation and sanitization is crucial to mitigate this risk and protect against exploitation.
