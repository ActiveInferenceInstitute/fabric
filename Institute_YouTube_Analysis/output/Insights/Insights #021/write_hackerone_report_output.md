**Title:** Interview with Professor Thomas Metzinger on Consciousness and Self-Model Theory

## Summary:
In this engaging interview, Professor Thomas Metzinger discusses his groundbreaking work on consciousness, including his self-model theory of subjectivity and the concept of minimal phenomenal selfhood. He explores the complexities of self-awareness, the nature of consciousness, and the implications of his recent book "The Elephant and the Blind," which examines pure consciousness through over 500 experiential reports.

## Description:
Professor Thomas Metzinger, a prominent philosopher of mind, elaborates on his self-model theory of subjectivity (SMT), which argues that consciousness is not a single problem but a bundle of issues regarding first-person perspectives and self-representation. He emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary cooperation between philosophy and neuroscience to better understand consciousness and subjective experience.

Matzinger's recent work highlights the importance of pure consciousness, which he defines through various experiential reports. He critiques traditional notions of self and proposes that awareness can exist without a self-model, as demonstrated in certain meditative and mystical experiences. The interview delves into the nature of reflexivity, the distinction between epistemic self-models and agents, and the challenge of understanding pre-reflective self-awareness.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Familiarize yourself with Metzinger's self-model theory by reading "Being No One" and other relevant literature.
2. Engage in meditation practices focusing on open monitoring to explore your own awareness and self-model.
3. Reflect on your experiences of consciousness, considering the distinctions between self, subjectivity, and awareness as discussed in the interview.

## Impact:
The insights from Professor Metzinger's work could significantly influence the fields of philosophy, cognitive science, and consciousness studies. His exploration of selfhood and awareness challenges conventional perspectives, potentially leading to new approaches in understanding the mind and the nature of human experience. The discussion encourages researchers and practitioners alike to reconsider their assumptions about consciousness and the self, fostering a deeper inquiry into the fundamental aspects of being human.
