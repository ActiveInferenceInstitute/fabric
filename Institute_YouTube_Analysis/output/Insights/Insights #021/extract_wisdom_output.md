# SUMMARY
Daris Parv Wayne hosts Professor Thomas Metzinger, discussing consciousness, the self model theory, and Metzinger's new book, "The Elephant and the Blind."

# IDEAS:
- Consciousness is a bundle of problems, not a singular issue, encompassing both empirical and conceptual aspects.
- The self model theory of subjectivity emphasizes the first-person perspective and its evolution in conscious systems.
- The phenomenal self model allows organisms to refer to themselves in the first person singular.
- Active inference connects cognition with self-representation, integrating various disciplines like philosophy and neuroscience.
- Conscious experience can exist without a phenomenal self, suggesting different levels of awareness and consciousness.
- The distinction between computational and phenomenal self models clarifies the relationship between self-awareness and subjectivity.
- The concept of transparency in self models relates to how systems experience internal representations of themselves.
- First-person perspectives involve epistemic relationships and can be modeled in various cognitive systems.
- Phenomenal states can be experienced without conscious thought, indicating layers of awareness in conscious beings.
- Non-egoic self-awareness represents a widespread phenomenon separate from the typical self-referential experience.
- The complexity of self-modeling may lead to dissociations between subjective experience and external reality.
- Out-of-body experiences can reveal insights into the nature of self and consciousness, challenging traditional views.
- The relation between the self and the world is complex and cannot be reduced to simplistic binaries.
- Non-reflective self-awareness can exist in states devoid of thought, emphasizing the fluidity of consciousness.
- The concept of pure awareness transcends traditional notions of self, prompting deeper explorations into consciousness.
- The interplay between ego and non-ego states highlights the richness of human subjective experience.
- Different phenomenological states reveal how consciousness can fluctuate between self-reference and pure awareness.
- The role of language in shaping our understanding of consciousness can complicate the exploration of subjectivity.
- First-person perspectives can be dissected into spatial and temporal components, revealing their intricate nature.
- The phenomenology of timelessness suggests that awareness can exist independent of conventional temporal experiences.
- Epistemic spaces allow organisms to model their environment, highlighting the dynamic nature of consciousness.

# QUOTES:
- "Consciousness is not one problem but a whole bundle of problems." 
- "What is a first-person perspective really? It’s a model of the intentionality relationship."
- "Everybody thinks this is a theory of Consciousness; no, the aim was to have an experience of subjectivity."
- "The notion of a first-person pronoun is a hybrid metaphor." 
- "There’s a lot of good work in analytical philosophy of mind on irreducibility in indexical expressions."
- "The aim was to construct a theory of how something like consciously experienced first-person perspective could have naturally evolved."
- "The whole idea of an intrinsic property is something I don’t believe in; only relational properties exist."
- "Pure awareness is not pure because it has a content."
- "The distinction between computational and phenomenal self models is crucial for understanding self-awareness."
- "There is a quality of giveness in inanimate objects which you can perceive if you look properly."
- "Many out-of-body experiences are special kinds of vestibular motor hallucinations."
- "The phenomenology of timelessness indicates that awareness can exist independently of time."
- "The signature of knowing can manifest without a contracted sense of self."
- "The quality of pure wakefulness is a foundational element of conscious experience."
- "Language can complicate our understanding of consciousness by imposing rigid structures onto fluid experiences."
- "The experience of pure awareness has a reflexive quality that can be both subtle and profound."
- "The relationship between self and world cannot be reduced to simplistic binaries."
- "The complexity of self-modeling may lead to dissociations between subjective experience and external reality."
- "What is consciously experienced is determined by local neural activity in the brain."
- "There is a dimension of consciousness that can be effortlessly experienced without reflective self-awareness."
