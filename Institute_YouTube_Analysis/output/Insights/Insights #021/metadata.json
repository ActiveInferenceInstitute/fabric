  "description": "Professor Thomas Metzinger might be the important philosopher of mind alive today. In this episode of Active Inference Insights, he and Darius dive headfirst into the murky, muddy waters of self-models, intentionality relations, consciousness metaphysics, phenomenology, and, last but not least, the question of whether there can be such a thing as a pure awareness state. This last question is the central topic of Professor Metzinger\u2019s new book, The Elephant and the Blind.\n\nThomas Metzinger\nhttps://mitpress.mit.edu/author/thomas-metzinger-2950/\nhttps://www.philosophie-e.fb05.uni-mainz.de/institutes/theoretical-philosophy/thmetzinger/\nhttps://philpeople.org/profiles/thomas-metzinger\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahuMDH4AAAAJ&hl=en\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
