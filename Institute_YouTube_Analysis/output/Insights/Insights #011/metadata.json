  "description": "This week\u2019s Active Inference Insights is a rollercoaster of all things cognitive, brought to you by Darius and philosopher / neurophenomenologist Julian Kiverstein. Over three hours you can expect to learn about non-representational cognition, affordances, the irreducibility of phenomena, self-modelling, the extended mind, consciousness and so much more. \n\nJulian Kiverstein\nhttps://www.juliankiverstein.com\nhttps://twitter.com/juliankiverste1?lang=en\nhttps://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=45y4-LkAAAAJ&hl=en\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Darius-Parvizi-Wayne\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
