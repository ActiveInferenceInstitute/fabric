  "description": "Active Inference Insights 013 is all about modelling: not only how we model our lived world, but also how we might scientifically model that modelling process ourselves. With neuro-computationalist Ryan Smith at the helm, expect to learn about the difference between empirical computational psychiatry and in-silico simulations, the role of aberrant precision-weighting in neuropsychological disorders and how a little parameter called \u2018gamma\u2019 might hold the key to a life of wellbeing.\n\nRyan Smith\nhttps://www.laureateinstitute.org/ryan-smith.html\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ScOne9wAAAAJ&hl=en\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Darius-Parvizi-Wayne\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
