- Collective behavior is qualitatively different from individual behaviors.
- There is a causal power of collective systems influencing individual actions.
- Collective behavior can emerge without direct interaction among individuals.
- Group living has evolutionary advantages, like reduced predation risk.
- Altruism in species like ants can challenge traditional views of individual fitness.
- The self may be inferred as a hidden cause in active inference.
- Free energy principles guide both biological and artificial systems.
- Complex systems may exhibit emergent properties that are not reducible to individuals.
- Predictive coding models can be used to understand dynamics of complex behaviors.
- The balance between accuracy and computational feasibility is a key concern in modeling.
