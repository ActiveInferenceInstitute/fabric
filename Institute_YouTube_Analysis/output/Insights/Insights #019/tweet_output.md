🌟 Excited to dive into today's episode of #ActiveInferenceInsights with my guest, Connor Hines! 🎙️✨ We’ll explore the fascinating intersection of biology, AI, and complex systems. 🧬🤖

Connor recently finished his PhD at the Max Planck Institute, focusing on the variational Bayesian inference in complex systems. 🧠📊 We'll discuss collective behavior, the role of context in inference, and even touch on the philosophical aspects of consciousness and agency! 🤔💭

Join us as we unravel the mysteries of how systems self-organize and how we might replicate this in artificial agents! 🧩💡

🔗 Tune in for a deep dive into the intricacies of life, cognition, and the science that binds it all together! 🌀✨ #CognitiveScience #ComplexSystems #AI #Neuroscience
