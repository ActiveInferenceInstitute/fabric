Welcome everyone back to Active Inference Insights. I am your host, Daris Parvy-Wayne, and today I am delighted to speak with Connor Hines. Connor has recently completed his PhD at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and is currently a researcher at Versus AI. His research centers on the apparent teleology of complex systems, particularly how these systems can be conceptualized as performing variational Bayesian inference in relation to their environment. Therefore, Connor extensively utilizes active inference and the free energy principle in his analyses of collective behavioral systems, making him an ideal guest for todayâ€™s episode. Connor, thank you for joining us. I am eager to learn from your insights.

To begin, I would like to address a broad, axiomatic question regarding your study of collective systems. Is there a distinction between collective behavior as an entity in itself and the behavior of an aggregation of individuals that comprise a group? When we discuss collective behavior, does it signify something beyond the mere sum of individual actions?

This inquiry has motivated my study of collective behavior. It relates to a larger unifying theme in complex systems science, which can be encapsulated in the phrase "more is different." The whole is greater than or different from the sum of its parts, which is particularly evident in the study of collective behavior. I would assert that there is indeed something qualitatively distinct when we focus on the system as a whole, rather than merely on its individual components. The ongoing debate concerns whether this emergent phenomenon exists merely at a descriptive level or possesses causal power that influences individual behaviors. Recent developments in complex systems science suggest that there is a qualitatively different aspect to the larger picture, beyond simply aggregating individual behaviors.

In sociocultural groups, the top-down influence is quite apparent. For instance, in economic systems, the economy operates with a form of circular causality involving the agents within it. However, in more mechanical complex systems, such as simulations, does an ontological emergence occur in the dynamics of the group as a whole that cannot be reduced merely to the summation of individual behaviors? If so, can we differentiate this from top-down causality? 

This is indeed a contentious topic. Research aims to quantify the extent of top-down causation, as we can always define macroscopic or coarse-grained variables from an ensemble of microscopic variables. For example, we might analyze a set of gas particles to derive quantities like temperature, average mass, or average velocity. The critical question is whether these coarse-grained variables exert influence on the lower-level constituents. My intuition, even within simulation contexts, is that they do, and researchers like Liel Barnett and Neil Seth at the University of Sussex have proposed measures such as dynamical independence to support this notion. It challenges our traditional understanding of causation, suggesting that coarse-grained variables can possess their own causal power and may even be more predictive of lower-level variables than the complete ensemble itself. 

Philosophically, this perspective complicates our understanding of causation. It raises questions about whether this is merely a different type of causation, akin to the distinction between constraint and causation articulated since Aristotle. For instance, macro systems may constrain the organization of micro systems. This is a massive question, rich in philosophical implications, particularly regarding strong emergence and weak emergence.

Now, turning to the topic of human or in silico simulations of cognitive agents, I want to inquire about the necessity of equipping individual agents with social priors to enable them to act as social agents. Is it feasible for them to develop an overall pattern merely through shared goals, without explicit references to other agents?

Certainly, there are various methods to introduce correlations or coupling between agents. Evidence indicates that animals and social agents often correlate their activities through direct or indirect perception of one another. For instance, fish in a school can sense their neighbors, and bacteria can detect each other through various mechanisms. However, there is no inherent limitation preventing the coupling of a system of particles to a common driving source. For example, if a group of particles is attracted to a food source due to biochemical gradients, they may appear to move as one entity even without sensing one another.

This phenomenon also manifests in neuroscience. When examining large-scale neural recordings, we often analyze a subset of neural activity, leading to inferred correlations between neural firing patterns. However, we cannot definitively conclude whether a third causal factor is responsible for these observed correlations. 

In my research on collective animal behavior, I have observed that tracking individual members of a group enables us to reconstruct their sensory fields. This allows for the decoupling of potential confounding factors from the actual social information utilized by individuals. 

The evolutionary implications of collective behavior are intriguing. For example, does the presence of others with shared goals confer advantages to individuals pursuing their own goals, or would it be more beneficial for individuals to operate in isolation? This question has been extensively debated within sociobiology, particularly regarding the advantages of group living.

One potential advantage is related to predation risk; living in a group can reduce the likelihood of any single individual being preyed upon. Additionally, there are psychological effects of flocking that affect predators, such as the crowding effect, which complicates the predator's ability to focus on a single target, thus lowering predation risk for the entire group.

Conversely, there are species that thrive as solitary predators, indicating a trade-off in the advantages of group living. Individual fitness motivations exist, such as those observed in flocking and schooling behaviors. A classic example is the predation risk reduction afforded by collective living, which suggests that individuals benefit from group dynamics.

Another intriguing consideration is that collective systems may create their own selection pressures, independent of the benefits conferred to individual members. This aligns with the free energy principle, which seeks to elucidate the conditions for the persistence of systems. My hypothesis is that certain group dynamics may exist even at the expense of individual fitness, suggesting that the macro scale may possess its own dynamic, self-evidencing existence, despite potential negative impacts on individual actors.

This perspective may be contentious, but it provides a valuable framework for understanding maladaptive group dynamics, such as misinformation and virality in social networks. 

The concept of control in group dynamics also raises philosophical questions. Intuitively, we may not perceive group dynamics as possessing agency. The overarching arc of culture appears to stem from individual actors, yet the constraints imposed by sociopolitical systems influence the actions of individuals. This leads to inquiries about the nature of agency and how we distinguish between individuals in systems characterized by shared genetic material, as seen in colonies of social insects.

This brings us to the challenge of identifying individuals within collective systems. The classical view of individuals as discrete entities becomes less clear in groups where roles and identities are dynamic. In systems where individuals exhibit self-sacrifice for the collective good, the delineation of individual versus collective identity becomes blurred. 

In conclusion, the study of collective behavior raises profound questions about the nature of individuals, agency, and the dynamics of complex systems. The interplay between individual actions and group dynamics continues to inspire inquiry across various fields of study.
