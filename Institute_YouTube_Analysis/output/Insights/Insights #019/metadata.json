  "description": "It\u2019s all well and good being able to capture the intelligence and behaviour of a single agent, but what about collectives of them? Is that even possible and, if so, what do those models tell us not only about the individuals that belong to that group, but also the dynamic that emerges over and above their respective contributions? To answer those questions and many more, Active Inference Insights welcomes Conor Heins, Senior ML Research Engineer at Verses AI Research Lab and PhD student at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour, to the show.\n\nConor Heins\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3OKMye8AAAAJ&hl=en\nhttps://www.ab.mpg.de/person/101190/2736\nhttps://twitter.com/conorheins\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Darius-Parvizi-Wayne\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
