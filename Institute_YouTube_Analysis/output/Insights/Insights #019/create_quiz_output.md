Subject: Active Inference and Collective Behavior

* Learning objective: Understanding the distinction between collective behavior and individual behaviors within a group.
    - Question 1: How does the concept of "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" manifest in collective behavior as opposed to individual behaviors?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Can you provide examples where collective behavior exhibits emergent properties that cannot be solely attributed to individual actions?
    - Answer 2: 
    
    - Question 3: Discuss the implications of top-down causality in understanding collective behavior. How does it differ from bottom-up explanations?
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Exploring the implications of active inference and the free energy principle in complex systems.
    - Question 1: In what ways does the free energy principle serve as a framework for understanding the dynamics of collective behavior?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: How might the principles of active inference challenge traditional reductionist views in the study of complex systems?
    - Answer 2: 
    
    - Question 3: Discuss the philosophical implications of downward causation as proposed by the free energy principle in the context of collective systems.
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Analyzing the role of social priors in the behavior of cognitive agents.
    - Question 1: To what extent do social priors influence the behavior of agents in collective systems, and can agents function without them?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: How does the presence of shared goals among agents contribute to the emergence of collective behavior?
    - Answer 2: 
    
    - Question 3: In what ways can a lack of social information lead to misinterpretations of collective dynamics?
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Investigating the evolutionary advantages of collective behavior.
    - Question 1: What are the trade-offs associated with collective living compared to solitary existence from an evolutionary perspective?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: How does the concept of predation risk illustrate the adaptive benefits of group living?
    - Answer 2: 
    
    - Question 3: Discuss whether collective behavior can be viewed as a self-sustaining system that influences individual fitness, even at a cost to individuals.
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Examining the relationship between internal and external states in the context of self and agency.
    - Question 1: How do internal states parameterize beliefs about external states, and what implications does this have for understanding agency?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: What challenges arise when attempting to delineate the boundaries between internal and external states in cognitive agents?
    - Answer 2: 
    
    - Question 3: Discuss the role of metacognition in the representation of self in relation to external agents or stimuli.
    - Answer 3:
