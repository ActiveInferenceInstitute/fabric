**Title:** Misconfigured CORS Policy Allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on site.com

## Summary:
A misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy on the `site.com` domain allows an attacker to exploit the application by injecting malicious scripts, leading to potential data theft and account compromise through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Description:
The vulnerability resides in the CORS implementation of `site.com`. An attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable endpoint that does not properly validate the origin. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an authenticated user's session.

For instance, when an attacker sends a request from an unauthorized origin, the response allows the injected script to execute. This could be done by manipulating the headers to include a trusted domain or by using a crafted URL to exploit the misconfiguration.

The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it can lead to data exfiltration, session hijacking, and unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim, potentially resulting in account takeover.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Ensure you are logged into the application as a normal user to have an active session.
2. Open a browser and navigate to the following URL:
   ```
   https://site.com/vulnerable_endpoint
   ```
   (where `vulnerable_endpoint` is the endpoint that has the CORS misconfiguration).
3. Using browser developer tools, modify the request headers to include:
   ```
   Origin: http://malicious-site.com
   ```
4. Observe that the response allows the script to execute and the arbitrary code is run in the context of the logged-in user.

## Supporting Material/References:

## Impact:
This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser session. This could lead to significant risks, including data theft, account takeover, and unauthorized actions within the application. The ability to perform these actions without proper authentication or consent poses a critical threat to user security and privacy.
