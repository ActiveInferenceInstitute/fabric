  "description": "For this special episode of Active Inference Insights, Darius is joined by psychiatrist, philosopher and literary scholar, Iain McGilchrist. Dr McGilchrist is best known for his account of the bilateral brain and the impact of hemispheric specialisation on personal, lived experience, as well as the unfolding of cultural epochs. In today\u2019s episode, Darius and Dr McGilchrist discuss the nature of attention, the primacy of relationality, consciousness and its connection to matter, as well as much more. \n\nWe apologise for the moments in which the audios overlapped. No rudeness was intended; unfortunately, the WiFi was erratic at times, leading to such audio issues.\n\nIain McGilchrist\nhttps://channelmcgilchrist.com/home/\nhttps://x.com/dr_mcgilchrist\nConsciousness and Matter Talk - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7O1Qa4Zb4s\n\nDarius Parvizi-Wayne\nhttps://twitter.com/dparviziwayne\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahuMDH4AAAAJ&hl=en\n\nActive Inference Insititute\nhttps://www.activeinference.org\nhttps://twitter.com/InferenceActive",
