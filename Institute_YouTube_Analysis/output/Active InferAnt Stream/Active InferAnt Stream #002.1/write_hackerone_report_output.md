**Title:** Insufficient Input Validation in Active Inference P3F Framework Leads to Potential Code Injection Vulnerability

## Summary:
The Active Inference P3F framework does not properly validate user inputs, particularly in JSON data handling, allowing attackers to inject malicious code that could lead to severe security breaches, including data leaks and unauthorized access.

## Description:
The vulnerability resides in the JSON data handling within the P3F framework of the Active Inference system. The framework accepts JSON files for properties, processes, and perspectives without sufficient validation or sanitization. This oversight allows an attacker to craft a JSON payload that includes executable code or malicious scripts.

For example, an attacker could submit a JSON file containing:
```json
{
    "property": "malicious_code",
    "value": "<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>"
}
```
If processed without validation, this could lead to the execution of the script in a context where it has access to sensitive data, such as user credentials or tokens stored in local storage.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could upload a malicious JSON file, which, when processed, would execute the injected code, potentially compromising user accounts or leaking sensitive information.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Clone the Active Inference repository from GitHub.
2. Modify the JSON file for properties, processes, and perspectives to include malicious code:
   ```json
   {
       "property": "test_property",
       "value": "<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>"
   }
   ```
3. Run the P3F framework's JSON processing function that handles user-uploaded JSON files.
4. Observe that the malicious script executes, demonstrating the lack of input validation.

## Supporting Material/References:

## Impact:
This vulnerability poses a severe risk to the security of the Active Inference system. An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the application, leading to potential account takeover, data exfiltration, and manipulation of sensitive data. The ease of exploitation and significant impact on user data integrity and confidentiality necessitates immediate attention and remediation to prevent malicious exploitation.
