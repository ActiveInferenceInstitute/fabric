Refined Text:

Greetings, and welcome to the Active Inference Stream on August 5, 2024. Today, we will engage in a linguistic analysis of fully synthetic, all-by-all dissertations. At a high level, each point in a principal component semantic space represents a written dissertation, transitioning from one field to another, following the work of Mike Lev et al. This session will focus on Field Shift 2, which encompasses a variety of objectives. For instance, one data point illustrates the term frequency distribution from "synthetic negotiation" to "synthetic quantum computation." I will elaborate on the concept of "synthetic" shortly, but this involves a PhD dissertation transitioning from negotiation to quantum computation.

We will explore similarity clustering across various domains. To begin, I am utilizing Cursor version 0.39, which was released just a few days ago and demonstrates significant improvements over previous versions. I will push 3,000 files to a major GitHub release; this process will take a few minutes. Once completed, I will create a new release on Zenodo, which simplifies the connection between GitHub repositories and Zenodo, enabling the assignment of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). After the GitHub push is finalized, we will release the repository, which will subsequently receive a new DOI and be archived on Zenodo.

Currently, in the background, the dissertations are being translated into Sanskrit and Arabic, resulting in the addition of new files. Let us check the status of the GitHub push. We have confirmed the update, and we are still using Cursor version 0.39. In the Active Inference repository, I have uploaded the code for Field Shift 2, which is generating thousands of all-by-all domain transitions. I borrow this terminology from the work of Mike Lev and colleagues, particularly their paper titled "Machine Learning for Hypothesis Generation in Biology and Medicine: Exploring the Latent Space of Neuroscience and Developmental Bioelectricity."

This paper discusses the significant role of AI in the scientific process, highlighting analogies and isomorphisms, for example, between neural synapses and cellular junctions, both bioelectrically and chemically. They also address broader concepts of functional invariance between neuroscience and developmental biology, which is promising. The paper outlines a BART-based domain translator, which processes material from one content area into an encoder that is subsequently decoded. Their research juxtaposes concepts from neuroscience and developmental biology, with data provided by several annotators to evaluate the quality of generated ideas.

Next, we will examine Field Shift 1 before delving into Field Shift 2. For Field Shift 1, I imported the plain text of the entire paper to analyze its implications. The dataset includes expressions from the neuroscience domain alongside analogous expressions from developmental biology. I will now present various domains relevant to Field Shift 2, including ATM transactions, biology, blockchain, cognitive security, and more. If any participants in the chat wish to suggest a domain, I will attempt to incorporate it on the fly.

In summary, we will explore how these domains interrelate and generate insights across disciplines. The structure of the files begins with a header indicating the domain, followed by numerous examples and questions, depending on the context. I will add new files to the domain folder based on suggestions. Our goal is to generate a comprehensive outline for a PhD dissertation that effectively bridges disparate fields.

Thank you for your engagement today, and I look forward to our exploration of these fascinating intersections in knowledge.
