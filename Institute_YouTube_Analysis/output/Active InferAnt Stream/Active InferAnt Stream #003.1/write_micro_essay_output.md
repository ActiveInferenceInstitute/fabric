Systems within systems are everywhere. They define how we interact, how we learn, and how we understand the world. When you start breaking down these systems, you often find other systems nested inside, much like Russian dolls. 

In coding, this idea becomes even clearer. As I dive into various projects, like the integration of William Blake's concepts into modern systems design, or the exploration of cognitive sovereignty through active inference, I see how these systems operate. Each code snippet, each algorithm, is a piece of a larger puzzle. 

For instance, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides a framework for transparency in government. Yet, within that framework are countless systems: the APIs, the request processes, the exemptions. Each one operates under its own rules while contributing to the larger system of accountability.

As I work through these projects, I often find myself pushing updates to GitHub, not just to save progress but to ensure that each system is functioning as intended. This iterative process highlights how systems must adapt and evolve. 

The challenge lies in understanding these interactions. How do these systems influence one another? How do they adapt to new information or changes in their environment? The more I explore, the more I realize that the key to navigating these complexities is to remain curious and open to the unexpected. 

Every line of code, every theoretical concept, is an opportunity to see how systems interact. Itâ€™s a reminder that nothing exists in isolation; we are all part of a larger tapestry of systems, continuously evolving and reshaping our understanding of the world.
