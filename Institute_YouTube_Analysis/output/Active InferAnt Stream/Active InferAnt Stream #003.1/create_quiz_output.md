Subject: Active Inference and Systems Design
* Learning objective: Understand the integration of active inference in multi-agent systems.
    - Question 1: How does the active inference framework differ from traditional reinforcement learning in terms of agent behavior and decision-making?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Discuss the role of belief updating in active inference and how it contributes to an agent's performance in a multi-agent environment.
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: Evaluate the implications of free energy minimization on the design and functioning of active inference agents within a social simulation context.
    - Answer 3:
    
* Learning objective: Analyze the contributions of William Blake's concepts to modern systems design.
    - Question 1: In what ways can William Blake's notion of "system" inform contemporary understanding of social systems within computational frameworks?
    - Answer 1:

    - Question 2: Discuss the relevance of Blake's concept of "cognitive sovereignty" in the context of active inference and agent-based modeling.
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: How might Blake's philosophy of systems influence the ethical considerations of designing AI systems?
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Examine the implications of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) on data transparency in systems.
    - Question 1: What are the main challenges associated with implementing the FOIA in the context of data systems and transparency?
    - Answer 1:

    - Question 2: Analyze how the FOIA can serve as a model for developing similar frameworks in other areas of governance or technology.
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: How can the principles of FOIA be integrated into the design of AI systems to enhance accountability?
