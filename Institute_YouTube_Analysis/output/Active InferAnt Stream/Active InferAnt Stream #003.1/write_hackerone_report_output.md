**Title:** Complex Active Inference Multi-Agent Simulation with Cognitive Sovereignty Insights

## Summary:
The project implements a multi-agent simulation utilizing active inference principles, inspired by the works of William Blake and concepts of cognitive sovereignty. It encompasses various components, including agent initialization, belief updating, action selection, and simulation visualization, resulting in a sophisticated system for analyzing social interactions.

## Description:
The simulation leverages active inference to model interactions among agents that represent different societal entities, including governments and corporations. The agents are initialized with matrices that express their beliefs about the world, which are continuously updated based on observations and actions taken. The system incorporates elements from Andrew Pasa's work on agent-based modeling, enhancing the complexity of interactions through structured simulations.

The simulation comprises several scripts that perform distinct functions:
1. **Main.py**: Executes the simulation, generating an entity library, running the simulation based on configuration parameters, and analyzing results.
2. **Utilities**: Contains helper functions for processing data, visualizing results, and managing agent interactions.
3. **Entity Extraction**: Processes texts from William Blake's works to identify key mentions of systems and entities, influencing the simulation's design.

The integration of cognitive sovereignty concepts explores how agents' actions can influence each other's belief states, representing a nuanced understanding of societal dynamics.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Clone the repository containing the active inference simulation.
2. Install the required dependencies, including any necessary libraries for data processing and visualization.
3. Execute the simulation by running `python3 main.py` in the terminal.
4. Observe the simulation output, which includes generated entity libraries, simulation results, and visualizations of agent interactions over time.

## Impact:
This simulation serves as a powerful tool for understanding complex social systems through the lens of active inference, providing insights into cognitive sovereignty and the dynamics of agent interactions. By utilizing advanced programming practices and open-source collaboration, it fosters an environment for continuous learning and improvement in the field of agent-based modeling and cognitive science. The potential for real-world applications and contributions to ongoing research makes this project significant for both academic and practical pursuits.
