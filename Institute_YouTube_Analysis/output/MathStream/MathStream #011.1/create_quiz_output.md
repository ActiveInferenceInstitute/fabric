Subject: Structured Active Inference

* Learning objective: Understanding the structure of active inference systems in relation to categorical systems theory.
    - Question 1: How does the concept of a Markov blanket differ in the context of active inference compared to traditional statistics, particularly in terms of its role in defining an agent's interface with the environment?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Discuss the implications of introducing a structured interface in active inference. How does this concept enhance the flexibility and adaptability of the agent's actions and observations?
    - Answer 2:

    - Question 3: In what ways does categorical systems theory allow for the precise formulation of morphisms, and how do these morphisms facilitate the comparison of different active inference systems?
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Exploring the relationship between generative models and action selection in structured active inference.
    - Question 1: How do generative models function as the core of an agent's conscious experience, and what role does the controller play in mediating actions based on these models?
    - Answer 1:

    - Question 2: Explain how the duality between the generative model and the controller can inform our understanding of action selection in active inference. What are the implications for modeling complex systems?
    - Answer 2:

    - Question 3: What challenges arise in formally linking action selection processes to perceptual inference within the framework of structured active inference, and how might these challenges be addressed?
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Investigating the potential applications and computational tools for structured active inference.
    - Question 1: Identify and discuss potential programming languages or frameworks that could facilitate the exploration of structured active inference systems. What features would make them suitable for this purpose?
    - Answer 1:

    - Question 2: How might the development of a proof assistant or computational tools based on categorical systems theory enhance the practical application of active inference in modeling complex systems?
    - Answer 2:

    - Question 3: Reflect on the importance of universal properties in active inference. How might these properties guide the design of algorithms for action selection and state inference in artificial agents?
    - Answer 3:
