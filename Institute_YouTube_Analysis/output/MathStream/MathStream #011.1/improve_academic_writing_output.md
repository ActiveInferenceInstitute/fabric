**Refined Text:**

Welcome to today's active math stream number 1111111111, recorded on August 12, 2024. I am joined by my colleague, Toby SMI, for a discussion on structured active inference. The session will begin with a presentation followed by a question-and-answer segment. Thank you, Toby, for joining us, and thank you to everyone watching and participating. We anticipate an enriching learning experience.

Thank you, Daniel, for having me again. Today, I will present my framework for structured active inference, which extends beyond traditional active inference to encompass any system characterized by compositional structures. I will clarify these ideas further as we proceed.

To understand structured active inference, it is useful to think about modeling an agent or a person transitioning onto a bicycle or into a car. Currently, this process may appear challenging because it involves altering the agent's Markov blanket, which I conceptualize as the agent's interface. To discuss this precisely, we must define what an interface entails. For instance, as one mounts a bicycle, the actions and attentional focus shift from walking to pedaling and leaning. This transformation signifies a composite system, merging the agent and the bicycle. A similar situation arises when entering a car. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that agents do not operate with a single set of observations or actions; instead, the composition of these systems necessitates flexibility. We must clearly articulate the sets of observations and actions involved.

The foundational idea behind structured active inference is to integrate the principles of active inference within categorical systems theory. Categorical systems theory provides a framework for understanding how dynamic systems are composed of parts and how these components interact. It differentiates the system's essence from its interface, allowing us to examine the agent's Markov blanket in detail and how it changes. This framework inherits several characteristics from categorical systems theory, particularly the structured interface concept, which enables us to define interfaces more precisely and understand how they interact with other interfaces.

As we delve deeper, I will discuss how categorical systems theory and structured active inference facilitate a modular understanding of active inference and enable comparisons between various agency models. This comparative analysis allows for the translation of systems between continuous and discrete time, among other distinctions. It is essential to note that categorical systems theory offers a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the inference and policy selection processes across diverse systems.

To summarize, structured active inference allows us to articulate the relationships between systems and their interfaces, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of agency.
