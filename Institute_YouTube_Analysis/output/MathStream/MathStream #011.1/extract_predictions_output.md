- Structured active inference will generalize active inference in a new direction.
- This framework will enable precise comparisons of different agency accounts.
- We will explore connections between various systems theories.
- By October 2024, structured active inference will be more widely understood.
- We will develop tools for building complex systems using this framework.
- The relationship between active inference and reinforcement learning will be clarified.
