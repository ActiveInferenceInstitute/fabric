  "description": "Jonathan Gorard\n\u201cA computational perspective on observation and cognition\u201d\n\nIt has become increasingly clear that a fully computational description of reality must somehow account for the relative computational sophistication of observers (including their processes of measurement, analysis and cognition) and the natural systems that they observe. An ongoing research program, based upon the mathematical formalism first set out in https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04690, seeks to use methods from category theory and topos theory to construct a purely compositional version of traditional computational and algorithmic complexity theory, within which an algebraic description of the tradeoff between observer vs. system complexity may be developed. It is claimed that this formalism has implications for the computational foundations of physics, mathematics, and potentially many other fields.\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
