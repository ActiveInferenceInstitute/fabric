- Could you speak a little bit about redundancy and Synergy with respect to fragility and other system properties?
- How might G be related with network controllability?
- How do you think about these kind of informational properties of systems or networks with respect to other systems properties?
- How do we deal with that when outside of dealing with these systems purely symbolically we actually want to be using certain partitions and identifying useful decomposed components?
- How do you bring something thatâ€™s kind of generalized across observers and types of variables and bring that from being kind of an analytical result into being something like the air conditioner is reducing the K Divergence about preferred temperatures with respect to courses of air conditioning?
- How would you connect this to the concept of known unknowns and unknown unknowns?
- What do you think about the relationship between redundancy and synergy in the context of cognitive modeling?
