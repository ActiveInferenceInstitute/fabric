**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome, everyone. Today is July 8, 2024, and we are convening for Active Inference Art Stream number 2.1, which focuses on a computational model of aesthetic value presented by Anman. The session will include a presentation followed by a discussion. I would like to express my gratitude for your participation, and I look forward to the presentation.

Thank you, Daniel, for the warm welcome. I am excited to discuss a computational model addressing a topic that many doubt machines can adequately represent: aesthetic value. This has been my focus for several years. Today, I aim to provide a high-level overview rather than delve deeply into the specifics of the model, which I have addressed extensively in my papers. It is equally important to consider why we should engage in developing and applying a computational model to something as complex as aesthetic valuation.

Aesthetic value is a term laden with grandiosity, yet its meaning is often intuitive and somewhat nebulous. When I refer to aesthetic value, I am discussing the pleasure derived from sensory experiencesâ€”something quite ordinary. We all experience this value when we choose to attend a concert, listen to a song, or admire a landscape. We encounter it when dining out and savoring a meal or when enjoying tactile sensations that compel us to linger. These pleasurable experiences, rooted in the sensory attributes of the objects we interact with, constitute what I personally define as aesthetic value. My mission over the years has been to create a computational model that elucidates how these values emerge and influence our behavior.

To address this question, I believe it is essential to ask an inherently computational question: What is aesthetic value, and what purpose does it serve? Why do we have emotional and affective reactions to sensory properties? Historically, researchers have proposed two distinct families of theories to explain the origins of aesthetic value. One of these, which I will refer to as "fluency theories," posits that aesthetic value signals ease of processing sensory stimuli. In simple terms, our brains favor stimuli that require less cognitive effort. Evidence supporting this theory includes our preferences for symmetrical stimuli and the mere exposure effect, where increased familiarity enhances liking. This theory, however, has been criticized for its oversimplification and failure to consider future implications, as it is primarily focused on present moment evaluation.

In contrast, the second family of theories, which I will summarize under the term "learning theories," suggests that aesthetic value functions as a signal for learning. This perspective emphasizes future adaptation rather than immediate sensory processing. It involves making inferences about our environment, recognizing perceptual errors, and reducing those errors, ultimately striving for better adaptation in the future. Both theories share a common goal: enhancing the processing of sensory perception, albeit with differing emphasis on the present moment versus future implications.

When discussing these theories with my doctoral supervisor, Peter Dean, we pondered whether it would be beneficial to simultaneously excel at processing our current environment while learning about potential future experiences. The model we developed seeks to achieve both objectives concurrently, balancing the recognition of present stimuli with predictions about future encounters. This duality manifests in everyday scenarios, such as crossing the street, where one must identify immediate surroundings while predicting the behavior of oncoming vehicles.

Our model aligns with prevalent machine learning frameworks, wherein agents make decisions based on immediate rewards while also evaluating past actions and their outcomes. I believe the sensory system, and the aesthetic value derived from it, should operate similarly. 

To illustrate what a computational model entails, it consists of code and mathematical formulations implemented in a programming language. This model simulates various stimuli and derives predictions. The specific model for aesthetic value is available on GitHub, and I strive to keep it updated. A crucial aspect of its utility, particularly for researchers like myself with a psychological background, is the interpretability of its parameters and functions.

Our model integrates two sets of functions, representing the fluency processing theories and the learning mechanisms related to prediction errors. By employing a simplified one-dimensional structure, we can visualize the model's operation, which captures the expectations of the sensory system as a probability distribution. For instance, when observing a dog, one relevant feature may be its fur length, and we assess how well the current environment meets our expectations. This readout informs us of the immediate value derived from processing fluency.

Furthermore, the model simulates learning by adjusting expectations based on current observations. Over time, it evaluates how long-term expectations align with ongoing learning processes, ultimately generating a reward based on the development of prediction errors.

While I have glossed over many details, I want to emphasize the importance of empirical validation. Collaborating with my master's students, we implemented the model in computer code to determine if it could produce predictions reflecting human behavior. One well-known phenomenon we investigated is the mere exposure effect, which illustrates how familiarity influences preference. Our model replicated this inverted U-shaped curve, demonstrating that increased exposure initially enhances liking but eventually leads to saturation and boredom.

Moreover, our model effectively predicted individual judgments about image preferences on a trial-by-trial basis, outperforming more simplistic models that assume uniformity in human responses. Our findings suggest that aesthetic evaluations are not merely coincidental but are rooted in systematic differences, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of aesthetic valuation.

We can further explore this model's capabilities by testing various configurations and identifying essential components. Additionally, this approach allows us to compare our findings with existing machine learning frameworks, highlighting the potential for aesthetic valuation to inform reward learning models.

As we continue to develop and refine our understanding of aesthetic experiences, I hope to foster greater collaboration and innovation within this field. Thank you for engaging in this discussion, and I welcome any questions or insights you may wish to share.
