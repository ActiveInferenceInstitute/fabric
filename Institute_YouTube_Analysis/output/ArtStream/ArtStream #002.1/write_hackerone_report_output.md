**Title:** Dual Processing of Aesthetic Value Through Computational Modeling

## Summary:
A computational model has been developed to analyze aesthetic value, emphasizing the dual processing of immediate sensory experiences and future learning. This model provides insights into how aesthetic judgments are formed and the implications for behavior in various contexts.

## Description:
The model addresses the inherent complexity of aesthetic value, which is the pleasure derived from sensory experiences. Two primary theories explain aesthetic value: fluency theories, which focus on the ease of processing sensory stimuli, and learning theories, which emphasize the role of aesthetic value as a signal for future learning. The proposed model combines both theories, enabling simultaneous processing of current sensory information and future expectations.

The model operates by evaluating sensory stimuli against established expectations, thus providing a reward mechanism based on immediate processing fluency and prediction error reduction. This dual approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of how aesthetic value influences decision-making and behavior.

The implementation of the model is available on GitHub, and it is designed for interpretability, allowing researchers to understand the underlying mechanisms driving aesthetic judgments. Initial tests demonstrate that the model can replicate established findings in aesthetic research, such as the mere exposure effect, and can predict individual preferences effectively.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Access the computational model from GitHub and install it on your local machine.
2. Run simulations using provided datasets to observe how the model predicts aesthetic preferences based on exposure frequency.
3. Adjust parameters related to fluency and learning to see how changes affect the model's output and compare results with empirical data from aesthetic studies.

## Impact:
This model not only advances the understanding of aesthetic value but also offers practical applications in fields such as marketing, art curation, and AI-driven recommendations. By elucidating the mechanisms behind aesthetic judgments, it provides a foundation for enhancing user experiences in various domains, ultimately bridging the gap between computational models and human sensory perception.
