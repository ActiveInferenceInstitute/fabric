- A computational model of aesthetic value will be developed.
- The model aims to explain how aesthetic values emerge and influence behavior.
- The model will incorporate both present moment processing and future learning.
- Predictions will be made about aesthetic experiences and how they are valued.
- The model will show how exposure affects liking through an inverted U-shaped curve.
- It will be possible to predict individual aesthetic judgments based on model parameters.
- The model's predictions will be validated through empirical data comparisons.
- Future work will explore the impact of context on aesthetic experiences.
- The model aims to integrate computational methods with psychological insights.
