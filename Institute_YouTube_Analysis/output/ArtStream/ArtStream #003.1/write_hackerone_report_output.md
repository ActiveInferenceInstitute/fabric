**Title:** Insights into the Neural Dynamics of Music Engagement and Curiosity

## Summary:
The presentation discusses the neural substrates involved in music perception, the role of predictive processing in our engagement with music, and the underlying motivations driving humans to connect with music. The exploration of how curiosity interacts with music listening highlights the intricate balance between pleasure, learning, and attentional dynamics.

## Description:
Diana Omegi, a senior lecturer and researcher at Gil University of London, explores the profound human drive to engage with music, noting that the average person listens to music for about 20.7 hours a week. This talk aims to uncover the neural mechanisms behind music perception and pleasure, focusing on the predictive processing framework, which explains how our attention shifts over time in response to musical stimuli.

The discussion includes insights into how our brains process music, the predictive coding principles related to pitch perception, and how congenital amusia impacts musical engagement. Research indicates that individuals with amusia exhibit abnormal prediction error signaling, suggesting a deeper, more generalized compromise in their ability to process musical information.

Omegi also delves into the dynamics of musical pleasure, revealing how anticipation and experience of 'chills' during music listening are linked to the activation of reward networks in the brain. She emphasizes the importance of individual differences, such as musical expertise and personality traits, which shape our engagement with music.

Additionally, the talk addresses the cyclical nature of music engagement, where peaks of attention and troughs of mind wandering are influenced by the complexity of the music being heard and the listener's expectations. The implications of these findings extend to understanding how we interact with music in various contexts and how curiosity can drive our engagement with musical experiences.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Attend a live music presentation or seminar where music neuroscience is discussed.
2. Engage in activities that involve listening to various pieces of music, both familiar and unfamiliar, while noting your emotional and cognitive responses.
3. Reflect on how your attention fluctuates during different pieces of music, considering factors such as complexity, familiarity, and curiosity.

## Impact:
Understanding the neural dynamics of music engagement can inform therapeutic approaches for individuals with musical anhedonia or congenital amusia, as well as enhance our appreciation of the multifaceted role music plays in human experience. This research underscores the potential for music to serve as a tool for learning, emotional connection, and social bonding, highlighting its significance beyond mere entertainment.
