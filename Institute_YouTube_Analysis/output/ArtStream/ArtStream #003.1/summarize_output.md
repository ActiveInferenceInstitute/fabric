# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Diana Omegi's presentation explores the neuroscience behind music perception, engagement, and pleasure, emphasizing curiosity and predictive processing.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Average person listens to music 20.7 hours weekly, highlighting music's significance in daily life.
2. Neuroscience reveals neural substrates of music perception and pleasure, affecting our music engagement choices.
3. Predictive processing framework explains attention shifts and engagement dynamics in music listening experiences.
4. Congenital amusia affects pitch discrimination and memory, revealing insights into music processing difficulties.
5. Music perception involves dual pathways: 'what' (ventral) and 'when' (dorsal), influencing expectation and timing.
6. Emotional responses to music are linked to brain connectivity between auditory and reward areas.
7. Curiosity drives engagement with music, influenced by unpredictability and personal musical expertise.
8. Individual differences, like musical training, affect attention and engagement in music listening.
9. Extended engagement with music features peaks of attention and troughs of mind wandering.
10. AI-generated music raises questions about listener engagement and emotional connection to the creator.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Music serves as a significant part of daily life, influencing emotional and cognitive experiences.
2. Understanding predictive processing can enhance our grasp of music engagement and attention dynamics.
3. Individual expertise and curiosity play crucial roles in how we perceive and enjoy music.
4. The interplay between neural pathways shapes our emotional responses and pleasure derived from music.
5. AI's role in music creation may alter our engagement and emotional connections to the music we listen to.
