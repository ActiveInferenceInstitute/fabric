**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome. It is April 26, 2024, and we are commencing the Active Inference Art Stream 1.1, which marks the beginning of a new art-related series. This series will feature engaging discussions and presentations, aptly centered on the theme of "Order and Change in Art," with Opo Frascaroli as the presenter. Additionally, Sander Vander Croise and Axel Constant will participate in the discussion. Thank you all for joining; we anticipate a productive presentation and discussion.

I would like to express my gratitude to Daniel and everyone present. It is a privilege to present to such a knowledgeable audience of active inference aficionados. The work we are sharing today, conducted by Sander Van Car and myself several months ago, addresses a topic that has been relatively overlooked in the active inference literature. However, as I aim to demonstrate, this topic is quite promising and has garnered increasing attention in recent years.

Let us dive directly into the subject matter. Our starting point is the remarkable convergence of interests and findings that has emerged over the past few years between scholars focused on the mind and brain from predictive processing or active inference perspectives, and those studying the arts and aesthetics through various lenses, including philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and the history of arts and artistic practices. This convergence is fostering an ambitious research program that benefits both domains. On one hand, predictive processing and active inference frameworks are increasingly recognized as useful for illuminating significant aspects of our aesthetic encounters and experiences. Conversely, the arts and aesthetics, viewed through these predictive processing or active inference lenses, provide insights into critical facets of mental functioning.

This presentation will explore these two research trajectories. The first concerns how we can illuminate aspects of aesthetic experience using active inference. In this context, we will clarify what we mean by aesthetic experience, introducing the concepts of sense-making and epistemic arcs from the active inference perspective. We will discuss how these notions can elucidate specific aspects of our engagement with the arts and our aesthetic experiences.

In the second part of the presentation, we will examine how our mental functioning can be illuminated by the arts and aesthetics when considered from the active inference or predictive processing perspective. We will explore an analogy between the processes of artists and cognitive scientists studying the mind, clarifying how an examination of the arts and aesthetics can shed light on the dynamics of inference, affect, and certain aspects of well-being and psychopathology. Finally, I will present conclusions and suggest future research directions.

To begin, let us clarify our explanatory target: aesthetic experiences. These experiences have been characterized in philosophical and psychological literature as those traditionally associated with beauty and the perception of beauty in various sensory arrays. We encounter these experiences with varying degrees of intensity in diverse circumstances, whether admiring a breathtaking vista or appreciating the arrangement of furniture in a living room. Most notably, aesthetic experiences often occur during our engagement with art—listening to magnificent music, contemplating visual art, or reading great literature.

A set of recurrent features is attributed to aesthetic experiences, which we aim to explain from the active inference perspective. First, aesthetic experiences are generally pleasurable and accompanied by a positive affective response. This does not imply that they are devoid of discomfort or difficulties; however, they tend to be pleasurable overall. Second, these experiences are self-sustaining; we engage with them without any ulterior purpose, continuously finding new elements to examine and appreciate. Third, aesthetic experiences are often transformative; upon finishing a painting, concluding a piece of music, or putting down a book, we feel changed in some way, typically for the better. Fourth, these experiences are subjective; what is aesthetically appealing to one individual may not hold the same appeal for another. Fifth, aesthetic experiences are transient and evolving; they are characterized by a changing cognitive and affective profile, culminating in a pleasurable response. Lastly, aesthetic experiences are often perceived as liberating, allowing a sense of freedom from existing constraints in our perceptual, cognitive, or motor processes, and enhancing our perception of possibilities for action.

The method we propose for explaining these characteristics involves introducing the concepts of sense-making and epistemic arcs, characterizing them from an active inference perspective. To illustrate these concepts, consider a common psychological example: an image that initially appears as a random array of black and white patches. With focused attention, one may eventually discern a cow within the image. This ability to derive meaning from ambiguous sensory input exemplifies sense-making.

From the perspective of active inference, the process of sense-making involves navigating uncertainty regarding the potential causes of our sensory stimuli. This uncertainty often prompts an expectation that it can be reduced, manifesting as curiosity. Curiosity, as characterized within active inference, involves the anticipated reduction of uncertainty, or expected information gain. When we engage with stimuli that promise clarity through focused attention, we may undertake epistemic actions—actions aimed at reducing ambiguity.

If successful, these actions lead to a reduction in uncertainty and an accompanying pleasurable affective response. The experience of finding the cow within the image, for instance, often elicits a positive reaction, commonly referred to as an "Aha moment." This process generates an arc from uncertainty to pleasure, although it is essential to note that this is an idealized experience, as various factors may lead to unsuccessful outcomes.

Now, let us relate this understanding back to art. Our contention is that art provides valuable epistemic assets, enabling idealized experiences of uncertainty reduction. For example, when engaging with a painting by Monet, viewers might initially struggle to identify the ships and water depicted. However, through focused observation, they may discern these elements, leading to an Aha moment and a pleasurable affective response. This process of ambiguity resolution is not limited to low-level perceptual understanding but extends to higher levels of interpretation, where meaning and emotional context become central.

As we explore this interplay between the dynamics of inference, affect, and well-being, we can see how understanding aesthetic experiences through the lens of active inference contributes to our comprehension of mental functioning and potential avenues for future research.
