- Decision-making models can benefit from aggregating diverse beliefs and perspectives.
- The ethical implications of AI personalization require careful consideration of competing philosophies.
- The Society Library's approach to knowledge can facilitate deeper public engagement with complex topics.
- Exploring stakeholder perspectives leads to a more nuanced understanding of contentious issues.
- Future policy discussions should prioritize inclusivity and comprehensive evidence over majority rule.

# QUOTES:
- "Our work automating the creation of deliberation graphs stemmed from our work building them by hand."
- "We feel as though independent public serving institutions should exist like digital libraries."
- "Essentially, it’s like really easy to bias our understanding of an issue by omission of data."
- "When we have questions like how far do you think personalization of AI assistant should go."
- "It’s important to get straight about what we mean about AI."
- "We’ve developed an ontology based on descriptive methods of how people tend to argue."
- "We think it’s helpful to traverse that for people and kind of create this linked library."
- "We’re working on modeling the logical relationships of which we accommodate 11."
- "Our goal is to provide maximal context and the maximum amount of information available."
- "Finding those most fundamental questions creates clear delineation for meaningful debate."
- "We’re a nonprofit organization and would love support."
- "We want to explore the space of enabling comprehension instead of supercharging persuasion."
- "It’s essential to recognize the evolution of debates over time."
- "We want to enable more free informed decisions."
- "The way you ask a question can be inherently biasing to a debate."
- "Our goal is not just majority rule but optimal policy based on preferences."

# HABITS:
- The Society Library emphasizes using diverse sources to enrich understanding and reasoning.
- Regularly updating knowledge graphs ensures relevance and accuracy in ongoing debates.
- Engaging with various stakeholder perspectives can enhance comprehension of complex issues.
