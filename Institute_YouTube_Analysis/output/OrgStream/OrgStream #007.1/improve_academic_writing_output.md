Greetings and welcome to everyone. This is ACT INF or Stream Number 7.1, taking place on March 20, 2024. We are joined by Jamie Joyce and Speaker John Ash. The agenda includes a presentation, followed by opening remarks and a discussion. Thank you both for your participation; we look forward to this event. 

My name is Jamie, and I am pleased to be here alongside John Ash, who collaborates with us at the Society Library. Today, we will discuss how we can interpret AI deliberations on a societal scale using established collective intelligence methods. These methods have been developed to aid in informing and enhancing decision-making. We have taught this methodology at 32 universities through educational programming and have been invited to extend this education to fact-checkers globally through the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). 

In addition to educational initiatives, the Society Library is focused on facilitating societal-scale debates on complex issues by creating knowledge graphs. We were invited to speak today due to our recent release of AI-generated deliberation graphs on topics related to AI. For instance, we have produced an advanced transcript of the debate between Connor Leahy and Beth Jos and subsequently created several debate maps that illustrate not only their arguments but also various counterarguments relevant to the topics they discussed. You can view these on our website; I will demonstrate their appearance shortly.

Our work in automating the creation of deliberation graphs originates from our previous manual efforts. Initially, we constructed linked knowledge graphs to map arguments, claims, and evidence from as many identifiable perspectives as possible, derived from approximately 12 different forms of media. These sources include economic impact assessments, scholarly articles, podcasts, and tweets. We model the exchanges of pro and con reasoning within these knowledge graphs. Previously, analysts spent thousands of hours manually searching through archives and the internet to find relevant knowledge, allowing readers to avoid this extensive effort.

Moreover, we do not only construct deliberation graphs; we also enable this intricate linked data from our knowledge graphs to be presented in more accessible formats, such as micro-voting decision-making models, which have been piloted at the city level. We also employ an interactive interface we refer to as "papers," which resembles a traditional paper but is unpacked across various dimensions of argumentation and linguistic register. This interface allows users to click on sentences to access detailed information akin to a Wikipedia entry regarding each specific claim.

The rationale for our approach is that libraries historically emerged in contexts where information was scarce. Their utility lay in providing a repository of commonly held knowledge. Today, however, we face an overwhelming abundance of information. It is crucial to discern irrelevant or duplicative data while ensuring that the most contextually relevant information is available on specific issues. Omission of data can lead to biased understanding. Thus, we believe that independent public-serving institutions, such as digital libraries, are essential for providing maximal context and information on complex issues without requiring individuals to spend thousands of hours in research and analysis.

Similar to how the Library of Congress serves as the intelligence arm of Congress regarding policy matters, we propose a reimagined digital public library in the 21st century that serves the public. This library would prioritize a diversity of views, demonstrating that complex policy issues often involve multiple competing perspectives with evidence and argumentation that may conflict. Many complex issues do not have definitive answers; they necessitate elucidation through value trade-offs and evidence assessment.

When confronting questions such as how far AI personalization should align with a userâ€™s preferences, we encounter numerous competing answers and philosophies, each supported by justifications and reasoning. For instance, one perspective posits that AI assistants like ChatGPT should be fully personalized according to user preferences, while another suggests that such personalization should be limited to avoid learning sensitive or potentially harmful information.

Given the constraints of our observation capabilities and the limited investigation into specific question spaces, it is beneficial to analyze existing work, reasoning, evidence, and public preferences, informed by the collective knowledge pool of civilization. This enables individuals to process how information is interrelated logically. Although we can demonstrate our findings later in this talk, there remains a gap between what we can automate with AI in constructing extensive maps of societal deliberation and what we can achieve through manual efforts.

As an example of our manual work, we recently engaged in a significant debate in California regarding the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, which was scheduled for closure in 2024 and 2025. The safety, environmental impacts, and utility of its energy production have been topics of debate for decades. We extracted logical reasoning from over 5,000 multimedia artifacts to create a state-scale representation of the California debate, linking thousands of arguments based on their logical relationships across economic, environmental, safety, political, and ethical considerations. We fact-checked and strengthened these arguments through supportive reasoning, a process that required over 8,000 hours of human research, equivalent to four full-time research years.

To illustrate, one claim from our analysis asserts that "market forces and financial incentives have rendered the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant redundant, non-competitive, and undesirable." This claim, while vague, can be unpacked into more specific arguments, detailing consumer demand trends in California. The complexity of this debate encompasses multiple layers of argumentation that can be meaningfully debated and supported by data.

The mapping process we developed by hand has allowed us to appreciate the complexity of communication facilitated by social media, where numerous individuals can contribute to discussions online. However, no platform has effectively enabled formal debate at the societal scale. While social media content is valuable, it often requires sifting through poorly developed points. The comprehensive model of California's debate was constructed over eight months by a team of analysts utilizing our tools and methods, primarily without automation by large language models, which we are currently working to improve.

As we examine AI debates, we encounter challenges, including the expansive scope of topics. For example, our recent hackathons generated 841 unique high-level preliminary categories for debate across various subjects, such as regulation, safety, alignment, goals, and future threats. The breadth of AI debates is staggering, and before engaging in discussions, we must address semantic ambiguities. Definitions of AI can vary significantly, and it is critical to source arguments and materials from diverse stakeholders to understand the varied contexts influencing reasoning.

At the Society Library, we study the cultures of different stakeholders to comprehend how context affects reasoning. For instance, in a recent Twitter exchange between AI safety advocates and a prominent figure, differing implications of "alignment" emerged, indicating contrasting views on trust and authority. Understanding these cultural nuances is essential for clarifying the implications behind claims.

We also face the challenge of calibrating the abstraction level of the knowledge we surface. Our ontology has been developed to link high-level sentiments and arguments to precise claims, enabling users to navigate through complex discussions more efficiently. For example, a sentiment about fears regarding superintelligent AI may be expressed as a projection. We break down such sentiments into structured arguments and premises to facilitate meaningful debate.

To illustrate, consider the statement that fears about superintelligent AI are merely projections from the LessWrong community. We can deconstruct this sentiment into a high-level argument with specific premises and conclusions. Engaging in meaningful debates requires breaking down sentiments into their constituent arguments and justifications, which can be supported by evidence.

Ultimately, our goal is to create a model that accommodates the complexity of societal-scale deliberation, enabling individuals to explore various perspectives and arguments. As we refine our methodology, we strive to ensure that our representations of debates reflect the evolving nature of discussions while maintaining an audit trail to the original references for transparency.

In summary, our organization, a nonprofit, welcomes collaboration and support as we continue to develop tools that facilitate informed decision-making. We aspire to create a digital library that serves both the public and decision-makers, enhancing the quality of discourse surrounding complex issues. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your questions.
