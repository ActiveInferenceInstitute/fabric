Governance is often viewed through a narrow lens, restricted to human institutions and structures. Nathan Schneider’s book, *Governable Spaces*, invites us to broaden that perspective. It suggests that governance isn’t solely a human endeavor; it’s part of a larger tapestry of life. This isn’t just about politics; it’s about how every living being interacts with its environment.

When Schneider talks about governance, he’s not merely discussing laws and policies. He’s reflecting on the intricate dance between power and cooperation that exists in nature. From the way bees organize their hives to how ecosystems maintain balance, governance is everywhere. It’s a fundamental aspect of life, not just a human construct.

In the digital realm, we see echoes of this natural governance. Online communities often mimic the patterns found in nature, though they’re constrained by the tools we use. Current platforms tend to default to hierarchical structures, which Schneider refers to as "implicit feudalism." This design limits our ability to self-govern and explore more democratic models.

To create spaces that reflect our values, we must design governance structures that empower users, allowing for genuine participation. This requires imagination and a willingness to look beyond traditional frameworks. By embracing the lessons from nature and acknowledging the interconnectedness of all life, we can craft digital environments that foster true democracy. The challenge lies in recognizing that governance is not just a set of rules; it’s a living, evolving process that we must continuously shape and redefine.
