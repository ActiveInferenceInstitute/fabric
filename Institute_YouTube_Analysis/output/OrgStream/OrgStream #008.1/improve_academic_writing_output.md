Refined Text:

Hello and welcome. It is April 9th, 2024. We are currently in Active Org Stream 8.1, featuring Nathan Schneider, who will discuss his work in the book *Governable Spaces*. There are many avenues we can explore, but first, I would like to express my gratitude to Nathan for joining us. Perhaps you could begin with a brief introduction before we delve into some quotes.

Thank you for having me; it is wonderful to be here. I have prepared two quotes and will also address any questions from the live chat or additional inquiries you may have.

This is a quote from page three of the book. Before we read it, could you provide some context regarding the book's purpose, publication date, and publishing details?

Certainly. The book was published in late February 2024 by the University of California Press. It is available for free online as well as in print from various book retailers. The book explores the significance of governance in our daily online lives. I have spent many years examining the political economy of online life and advocating for the development of alternative platforms designed as cooperatives. In this work, I take a step back to consider our political experiences in everyday life and their relevance. The book begins with a historical overview of how our online lives have been structured and managed, and it expands to suggest that some daily practices may be contributing to the decline and crisis of democracy more broadly. Ultimately, it is a plea for recognizing the potential for improving democratic engagement in our online spaces.

Here is a quote from page three that resonated with me, particularly in relation to active inference and the idea of a two-way street. The book heavily emphasizes the interactions between human politics and technological systems, yet it acknowledges that the more-than-human world surrounds these dynamics, presenting both the stage and stakes. The text raises critical questions about governance, asserting that wild creatures navigating a fragile world can expect no rights or decision-making powers from physics and biology. A government's claim to authority is insignificant in a wilderness where residents have become ungovernable in response to hostile forces. Governance, in its various forms, is an essential process for all life forms, as it involves orchestrating perceptions and reactions to thrive in their environments. This notion of governance can be viewed as the intersection of power and cooperation, a phenomenon not unique to humans.

What prompted you to articulate this perspective?

That is a great question. There was a specific moment that inspired this idea. I was early in conceptualizing the work that eventually became this book during a retreat at a Catholic retreat center in Colorado. While walking, I felt a profound sense of embarrassment reflecting on my work surrounding voting systems and blockchain technologies. Observing the interactions among the creatures around me, I realized that governance is not unique to humans. It became apparent that the themes I explore in the book are omnipresent in our surroundings. I sought to connect the question of democracy in human societies with the recognition that, while democracy does not manifest in the ecosystems, forms of governance are at play. This acknowledgment is crucial, as neglecting the natural world limits our understanding of our own potential. The book emphasizes that we need to intentionally craft our governance structures while recognizing that we are part of a more complex system than traditional political science often appreciates.

This perspective aligns with ecological views, which often explore how natural systems inform governance concepts. For instance, discussions about governance in ant colonies or beehives can be seen as metaphors for human systems. However, we must approach this carefully; while biomimicry offers insights, it does not necessarily provide direct answers for human governance. What is your stance on the concept of naturalness in governance?

I draw upon thinkers like Adrienne Maree Brown, who frequently employs biomimicry language to understand political change. She is associated with various liberation movements and emphasizes that the language and metaphors of biomimicry can help illuminate our political landscapes. I find her insights valuable and use them to deepen my understanding of democracy, particularly in relation to Alexis de Tocqueville's observations regarding civic associations and democratic life within communities. Healthy democracies often reflect vibrant democratic practices in everyday environments. Brown's recognition of fractals and how small-scale systems can resemble larger ones is essential for understanding our online lives and their impact on democracy at larger scales. We must also be cautious when drawing these parallels, as democracy is an imaginative endeavor that can only be realized through our collective imagination and practice.

One project I explore in the book is "governance archaeology," which I am developing with political scientist Bica Carugati. We aim to broaden the repertoire of governance histories available to us by creating databases that catalog historical governance practices. We should reflect on the foundations that have shaped our governance structures and consider alternative histories that could inform our current practices.

Moving forward, what are your thoughts on the role of visualizations and art in governance?

I believe that the interplay between words and images is vital for understanding governance. I collaborated with Daria Medved, a talented artist and digital rights activist, to create illustrations for the book that capture the essence of the interfaces we discuss. Traditional screenshots often fail to convey the user experience adequately. Therefore, we aimed to create illustrations that highlight significant aspects of these interfaces and reveal their phenomenological impact. The metaphors we use to describe online spaces are crucial in shaping our political imaginations. By recognizing these metaphors, we can better understand how our experiences with technology influence our governance structures.

In conclusion, what future directions do you see for Metagov and your lab's research?

Metagov is an open community, and I encourage those interested to join us at metagov.org. We have various research projects focused on topics such as attention economies and governance design, as well as public AI and the governance of philanthropy. My lab at CU Boulder, the Media Economies Design Lab, primarily works with graduate students. I welcome inquiries from those interested in pursuing master's or PhD research in areas related to democratic economies or online governance. Thank you for your engagement in this important conversation.
