**Title:** Governance Gaps in Online Spaces: Implicit Feudalism and the Future of Democracy

## Summary:
The discussions led by Nathan Schneider highlight significant governance issues within digital environments, particularly the concept of "implicit feudalism" that hampers democratic practices. This report emphasizes the need for modular governance structures that promote citizen engagement and creativity in online platforms.

## Description:
In Nathan Schneider's recent work, he discusses how traditional governance structures often lead to a form of implicit feudalism in online spaces, where power is concentrated in the hands of a few administrators or moderators. This structure is a form of meta-governance that obscures the underlying power dynamics, making it difficult for users to actively participate in decision-making processes.

Schneider advocates for a reimagining of governance in digital environments through the introduction of modular politics. By allowing communities to assemble their governance structures from various modules, users can create systems that better reflect their needs and values. This contrasts sharply with the current default settings of many online platforms, which often perpetuate hierarchical control.

Additionally, Schneider draws on the metaphor of a community garden to illustrate how governance can be more organic and participatory, suggesting that digital spaces should be cultivated in a manner that encourages collaboration and shared responsibility.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Analyze the current governance structures of a digital platform (e.g., social media, forums).
2. Identify instances of implicit feudalism by examining how power is distributed among users and administrators.
3. Propose a modular governance model that allows for user-defined roles and responsibilities.
4. Implement a pilot version of the modular governance model within a small online community.
5. Gather feedback from community members to refine and iterate on the governance model.

## Impact:
The implications of this work are profound. By acknowledging and addressing the governance gaps in online spaces, we can foster more democratic practices that empower users. The shift from implicit feudalism to modular governance can lead to more equitable, transparent, and participatory online environments, ultimately enhancing democratic engagement in both digital and physical spaces.
