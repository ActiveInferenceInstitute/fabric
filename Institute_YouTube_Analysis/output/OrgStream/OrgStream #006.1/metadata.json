  "description": "d20 is a Discord bot that allows communities to experience how communication and governance interact in an LLM-mediated environment. Communicate: d20 moderates the group's governance communication through different \"culture modules\" - playfully modifying users' messages to cultivate diverse interaction environments for participants. Interact: Groups can come together to embark on a governance \u201cquest\u201d, where they make lightweight decisions about the their group and experience varied mechanisms of decision-making.\nThe team working on this project will give a presentation on the background of the project, overview the development process, conduct short interactive demos, and explore practical applications and complementary research questions.\nWebsite: https://metagov.github.io/d20-governance/\n\nGuest:\nCent Hosten\nJanita Chalam\nHazel\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
