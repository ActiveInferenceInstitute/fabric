# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Chapter nine discusses applying generative models to empirical data, focusing on active inference in computational psychiatry and neuroscience.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Chapter nine builds on previous chapters, focusing on empirical data application of generative models.
2. Metab Bayesian analysis contrasts subjective models of agents with objective models created by researchers.
3. The goal is to recover unknown parameters of an agent's subjective model using observed behavior.
4. Computational phenotyping classifies individuals based on model parameters derived from observed behaviors.
5. The chapter outlines a six-step process for empirical data collection and analysis in active inference.
6. Variational analysis is used to recover model parameters and improve understanding of behavior.
7. The process involves formulating models, specifying likelihood functions, and setting prior beliefs.
8. Active inference can be applied across various fields, including computational psychiatry and neurology.
9. The chapter emphasizes the importance of empirical data in validating theoretical models.
10. Understanding active inference aids in developing AI technologies that mimic biological learning processes.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Active inference integrates empirical data with theoretical models to enhance understanding of behavior.
2. Metab Bayesian analysis helps differentiate between subjective and objective modeling perspectives.
3. Computational phenotyping allows for classification of subjects based on inferred model parameters.
4. A structured six-step process facilitates effective data collection and analysis in active inference studies.
5. Insights from active inference can inform the development of advanced AI systems.
