Refined Text:

Welcome back, cohort 5. We are now engaged in our second discussion on Chapter 9. Andrew or any other participants who wish to pose a question or raise their hand, please feel free to do so. I just heard the recording notification; perhaps there is something about Pete's Coffee that induces a time dilation. Regardless, we will focus on Chapter 9. Where shall we begin?

If anyone has specific points they would like to discuss regarding this chapter, I am happy to address those. Alternatively, for those who could not attend the previous meeting, I can provide a general overview of the chapter's contents. If you don’t mind, a general overview would be beneficial, especially for those who were unable to attend the last session.

Certainly, let us proceed with that. This chapter contains substantial content, akin to Chapter 6, which outlines a general framework for composing generative models and the broader methodology applicable in the context of active inference as explored in the second half of the book. Recall that in Chapter 7, we were introduced to the Predictive Processing (PDP) model and how to construct it. Chapter 8 expanded on continuous models, and here we return to the application of these models, focusing on how to utilize them in empirical experiments that involve collecting real data.

We are transitioning from a purely theoretical approach of building models and conducting simulations to gathering empirical data, such as neurophysiological data (e.g., EEG) or behavioral observations of various subjects, including humans and rats. In engineering contexts, one might also analyze different types of extracted data. Our objective is to determine the underlying processes generating this data, although we may never fully uncover them; nonetheless, we can strive to model them.

This chapter is quite dense, especially as it integrates multiple concepts, but it effectively guides us on how to apply these methods to empirical data. The introduction hints at the key themes that will unfold throughout the chapter. Notably, we are introduced to the concept of Bayesian analysis, which juxtaposes the agent's subjective model against our own objective model that we construct of the agent's subjective experience. This consideration is integral to the ontology of active inference, as we must recognize our role as objective scientists attempting to model behaviors and parameters of entities distinct from ourselves—such as understanding the subjective model of a rat, for instance.

Our goal is to recover or infer the unknown parameters of the subject’s brain and its subjective model using our objective observations. By inverting our objective model, we can infer those parameters and subsequently test and compare hypotheses. For example, we might identify several potential models, compare them, and ascertain which aligns most closely with the observed behavioral outcomes. 

Furthermore, the chapter introduces the concept of computational phenotyping, which allows us to classify individuals—whether they are multiple rats in a maze or clinical patients—based on the models we develop to explain their behavior. This chapter is particularly relevant to computational psychiatry, neuropsychology, and neurology, but the methodologies described can be broadly applied to a wide array of phenomena, including non-living systems.

In Section 9.2, we encounter Bayesian theorem, where Equation 9.1 is nearly identical to previous equations, except that we have substituted observations and states with behavioral outcomes and actions to be taken, represented by a theta symbol that denotes model parameters. Just as we update a model's beliefs related to states and observations through likelihoods and posteriors, we aim to map outcomes to model parameters. 

I will pause here. Bre, do you have a question?

Yes, I am curious about the computational phenomenology and the subjective model you mentioned. Are you suggesting that it is possible to input values into the matrix you referred to, and that these encoded values will contribute to the computational phenomenology? How does this process work?

To address that, we can refer to Section 9.5, which outlines a series of steps for this process. In Step One, we collect behavioral data, which could be organized in a spreadsheet format where each row represents an individual subject (e.g., rat number one, rat number two) and the columns detail their observed actions and associated observations. For instance, if we are administering a drug to certain rats and not to others, we could indicate this with a binary value (1 or 0) for each rat.

In Step Two, we formulate a PDP. This chapter examines discrete models, and as discussed in Chapter 7, we aim to derive a model that closely approximates the data collected in Step One. We recognize this as our objective model, while the inner box represents the subjective model we are attempting to devise based on the rat's experience.

This leads us to Step Three, where we specify a likelihood function based on our developed model. In Step Four, we define prior beliefs regarding the parameters in terms of expectations and precisions, often centered around zero, with precisions reflecting plausible ranges. Essentially, we hypothesize about our prior beliefs and proceed accordingly.

In Step Five, we solve for posterior probabilities and model evidence, continuing our effort to approximate the subject's subjective model. We consider all components, including likelihood functions and prior beliefs, and may refine our model to better reflect the subjective reality of the agent.

I will pause here for any further questions or clarifications.
