🚀 Welcome back, cohort 5! 🎉 Let’s dive into our second discussion on Chapter 9! 📚 If anyone has questions or thoughts to share, feel free to jump in! 🤔💬 

Just heard the “recording in progress” notification! 🎙️ Maybe it’s Pete’s Coffee causing time dilation? ☕️⏳ Let’s get started! 

If you missed the last meeting, I'm happy to provide an overview of the chapter! 📝🤓 There’s a lot going on as we explore how to apply active inference to empirical data collection! 🧠💡 

We’ll discuss concepts like metabased analysis, computational phenotyping, and more! 🔍✨ So, where should we begin? 🤷‍♂️ 

Let’s make this discussion engaging and insightful! 💡🤝 #ActiveInference #LearningTogether
