- where shall We Begin?
- if anyone has any particular points they want to get into with this chapter happy to jump into those otherwise um if anyone's like you know only able to make this meeting ween able to make the last one I’m happy to kind of give a general overview of what's going on here uh if you don't mind a general overview would be good to start with if other s c yeah go for it
- Bres you had a question uh yes uh actually uh I’m um I’m just wondering so you mentioned mention this computational yeah exactly this one you mentioned computational phenomenology and this subjective model are you saying that uh I don’t know anything about it so I’m just asking uh are you saying that somebody can actually start uh plugging in values inside that uh uh that Matrix that you said like and there will be like like what I’m saying is the values which you encode into that and some and some variables since you encode will be part of that computational phenomen ology or How does it go?
- so one thing we could do to try and answer that question is to look at like we have in section 9.5 just a nice like brief series of steps for how to go about this um and so like in Step One quite simple we collect behavioral data um you could even think of this as like a a spreadsheet or something along those lines like that kind of structure where each row can represent an individual like in a tm's example we have um rat number one rat number two we could have uh in the columns things like what are the what are the actions or that they took that we we saw whenever we collected the data um what are the associated observations um or or or other components of a model that we saw we could also have like other kinds of information like maybe the test was being done by administering um a drug to certain rats and not to others to try and study the impact right so we could have like a binary one or zero um like if for each rat if it was administered the drug or not um step two we formulate um a PDP this this chapter is a little bit on looking at discret models so a PDP as we were introduced to in chapter 7 although later they do give us a couple examples of um more continuous models and what we're trying to do with step two is that we're trying to develop basically yeah derive a model that like closely approximates what we see in the data that we just collected in Step One um but nonetheless we know that like this is our model so this is kind of that outer objective model that we're seeing in uh in the figure that Daniels pulled up there figure 9.1 so it's kind of that that inner box is the subjective model we're trying to to basically yeah devise our own objective model of what's going on in the rat's uh mind so to speak if we follow te's example um so that it there could be aspects of this that um because your question had to do with specifying priors um step three is specifying a likelihood function um and that’s based on the model that we just tried to make then after that step four we specify prior beliefs um and so in that step the way they've written it we can specify prior beliefs about the parameters in terms of expectations and precisions often these will be centered on zero with precisions reflecting plausible ranges so you might think of that is you have your own hypothesis about what the prior beliefs are um and you just kind of roll with it so to speak you we’re doing a process where we’re trying to build a model that whenever we run that model it and and run a simulation with it hopefully it more or less approximates the real actions uh that say a rat and a teamas uh took as well as like the combination between those and the observations that the rap received so um hopefully that provided some kind of information or a bit of an answer to your question
- so so you’re saying that if um suppose we found some empirical study and we get get the exact value not exact value but like a like a distribution a Goan distribution of the prior then that will be that will be the best that will be very helpful right?
- so you’re saying that if um suppose we found some empirical study and we get get the exact value not exact value but like a like a distribution a Goan distribution of the prior then that will be that will be the best that will be very helpful right?
- so what about if we if you are um like we don’t exactly follow the likelihood function the way they’re giving where they’re giving uh but we uh introduce our own function which actually does the likelihood mapping like not a function or or a methodology and uh on top of it so so so actually the fundamentally like we’re using this Marian processes to do the state transitions right so we have flexibility that we use uh uh we what I’m actually trying to say is that this three this likelihood function right which starts from the policy level uh right fundamentally down to the observation level and uh instead of following the exact mechanism which they give we can introduce our own methods but we uh do the mapping of transitions across States and the observation mapping like the a matrix and the B Matrix we keep it very similar uh but the other uh the the the higher levels the higher uh levels that can plausibly be changed also right if we it’s like we can apply a free energy principle to that also I’m just uh I’m just think on those lines I’ve not been able to formalize it very cleanly but uh I hope that in a few weeks time I’ll have more clarity
- could you please tell those values what what is a p mu Tilda that’s the policy what is Theta what is what is O and what is M?
- what’s the name yes the constrained for Factor graph oh okay yeah
- so that’s uh really interesting and really helpful thank you um am I this maybe a kind of blindingly obvious uh question is the focus of this book or indeed of the active inference program in the general sense more about understanding active inference as it exists uh rather than say developing active inference as a generic AI technology to solve uh um issues where we’re not necessarily the model the generative model is not necessarily active inference related?
- have you guys worked on any kind of int is it entirely within the jul or do also do some kind of Integrations suppose?
- are you like trying to say create some functions which will say do a thing like say minimize surprise or say calculate varal free energy for you guys like just create a function which will do that?
