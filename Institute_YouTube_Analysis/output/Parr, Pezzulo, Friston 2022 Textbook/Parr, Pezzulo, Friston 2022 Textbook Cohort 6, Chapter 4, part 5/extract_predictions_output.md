- Chapter 4 presents the kernel of active inference.
- Discrete and continuous time models will be explored in later chapters.
- Active inference applies to both cognitive functionalities and physical systems.
- The relation between sensory perception and cognitive function is complex and crucial.
- Predictions in active inference can be examined through coding exercises.
- The distinction between bold and italicized notation in equations is unclear.
