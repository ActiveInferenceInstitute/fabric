# QUOTES:
- "There’s a clear parallel setup... but there’s some very edges that are different between the two."
- "One of the really cool things about AAS graph is because the edges represent the sparsity of causal connections."
- "Each unit of four is kind of like a level in a nested hierarchical model."
- "The dynamical motif is going through time, emphasizing the sequence of observations coming in."
- "Both of these are like two flavors and then they are going to revisit it."
- "Policy especially... is trying to call back to reinforcement learning literature."
- "The continuous time setting doesn’t do explicit planning."
- "The strength and the weakness of the discrete time... is that there’s an exponential explosion."
- "The brain entertains multiple causal hypotheses about events."
- "Active inference helps us say... here’s the affordances they have and the time scales over which they have them."
- "Behavior assumes consciousness... so if we say sensing and responsive to one surrounding, then we have to say plants have a consciousness."
- "We can only work with what we can work with at a time."
- "If something’s missing, change the world or change your mind."
- "Every moment is a branch point... defined by the affordances that can be taken at that point."
- "The chapter is kind of the heart of active inference, albeit described in a very notational way."
- "We can’t just focus on... just ignore the perception for the next time steps."
- "There’s no single order for going through active inference."
- "Cognitive systems are systems of systems, intertwined with social and environmental dynamics."
- "The distinctions in notation reflect the complexity and diversity of active inference models."
- "There are situations where one explains all the variation, but there are situations where it explains none."
