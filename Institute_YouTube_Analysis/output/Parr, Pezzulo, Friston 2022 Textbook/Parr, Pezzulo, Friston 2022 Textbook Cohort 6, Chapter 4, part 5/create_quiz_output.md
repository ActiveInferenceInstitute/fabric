Subject: Active Inference and Generative Models
* Learning objective: Understand the structural similarities and differences between discrete and continuous time models in active inference.
    - Question 1: What are the key structural similarities and differences between the discrete and continuous time models as presented in figures 4.4 and 4.6, and how do these differences affect the computational capabilities of each model?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Discuss how the concepts of hierarchy and nesting in figure 4.4 relate to the unfolding dynamics through time in figure 4.6. What implications do these relationships have for understanding active inference?
    - Answer 2: 
    
    - Question 3: How does the representation of causal connections in Bayesian graphs change when transitioning from discrete to continuous time models, and what are the implications for message passing in each context?
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Analyze the role of policy variables in active inference and their relationship to reinforcement learning.
    - Question 1: How does the structure of the policy variable (Ï€) differ in discrete versus continuous time settings, and what does this imply for the implementation of active inference in computational models?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: In what ways does the concept of affordances in active inference relate to the definition of policy, and how does this relationship manifest in practical applications such as robotics or motor control?
    - Answer 2: 
    
    - Question 3: What are the computational challenges associated with representing policy spaces in discrete versus continuous time models, and how do these challenges influence the efficiency of decision-making processes?
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Discuss the integration of active inference with broader cognitive and ecological systems.
    - Question 1: How does the concept of active inference serve as a unifying framework for understanding cognitive processes across different systems, such as animals and artificial agents?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: What are the philosophical implications of viewing consciousness as a continuum across different entities (e.g., plants, animals, machines) in the context of active inference, and how does this perspective challenge traditional views of cognition?
    - Answer 2: 
    
    - Question 3: In what ways can active inference inform our understanding of the interactions between organisms and their environments, particularly in terms of adapting to ecological changes?
    - Answer 3:
