- what um was your question before we begin?
- could you comment on the main point of this uh of of this paper?
- so it’s one of the top down approach to look at active inference?
- what do we want to look at or make a model of or is there an empirical data set that we want to connect it to or a type of empirical data that we want to connect it to?
- does it actually read the paper and the documentation?
- I want to ask about the the gp4?
- is agent based modeling uh a field suitable for active inference?
- I wonder if there is value to be added if you if you bring the active inference discipline into that field?
- I wonder if that’s a good uh topic for a master thesis?
- did Jeff mention mutation agents?
- what would be the next level of sophistication that’s not there yet in PDP?
- beyond the yeah the rat of the maze what do you what do you see will be the next step in evolution of the models?
