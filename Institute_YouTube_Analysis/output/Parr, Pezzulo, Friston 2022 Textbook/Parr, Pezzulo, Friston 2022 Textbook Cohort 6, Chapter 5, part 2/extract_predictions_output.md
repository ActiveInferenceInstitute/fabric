- Dopamine increases precision in brain's understanding of policies.
- This connection between dopamine and policies is established in Chapter 5.
- Low dopamine levels in Parkinson’s leads to freezing of gait.
- Techniques exist for Parkinson’s patients to overcome freezing episodes.
- Active inference models can better fit variance patterns in data.
- Statistical modeling of the brain aids in understanding behavior.
- Multimodal capacities in active inference models enhance data interpretation.
- Future discussions will cover interactions between chapters six and seven.
