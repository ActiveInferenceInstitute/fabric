all right it's September 8th 2024 this is a personal Channel followup today after followup on math stream number eight which was two days ago on the 6th with shanon and Hector and Dean the slides are published at this link here and in the video description and the video of the math art stream 8 is here the goal of this follow-up paper stream is to learn again reflect also follow up on some of the quotes and the links that were not included in the presentation of this one just to do do a look at it again and see what happens and of course anyone with comments or questions just go for it and periodically all try to address them okay this was arising within the context of the math art stream Series so we know at least we have an edge with math and art and it being a math art frence Triad already we have active inference in there as well and then here throwing in the fourth happening vertex on the t is William Blake so the sort of before the during or the during that is uh or the before that is during what might Blake have to do with any of this other than just Whimsical possibility take a view on Blake's view on art this Edge one of the edges that's been most and copiously discussed which is awesome there's more more than too much out there then look a little bit more at Blake's view on math and science and then Round the Corner to active inference and then again with the four where so thinking about what could even be entered into and linearly okay maybe one maybe add a little two what could really be done uh classical considerations for whom and for why from or towards where just how and when to do it what what is math art even if we can or can we separate out art and math what is active inference classic questions and then what about all these other words and ways like active math art forence or other languages all these things would it be for whichever of these or another one would it be defined by its process or by the outcome like was it about about making an etching or the fact that the etching was completed was it about one knowing that they were making an etching was it about others like art and decoration is it is it about one thing or is it already multiple are are there conditions upon that that it's like well if it's pencil it's always art but if it's pen it's sometimes art or if if a robotic arm did it it would never be or it would be sometimes and then just even reflecting on oh how did that become our goalposts and rules and norms and priors and did we always feel that way about how that would have been on all these so first to jump in on William Blake and art previously in a 52 living ideas activity in January 2023 and then also I think immediately after on the personal Channel just similarly to here I looked at Blake's productivity and times in life in the context of also with Buckminster Fuller so more details on the productivity and those kinds of splits and uh contrasts these are good entry places and also it's awesome that there's such a large active Blake publishing and SC scholarship culture and approach with like Blake society and the Blake archive and and a lot of the available works so here during the math art stream it was like what is gothic and it's it's also been interesting to have some conversations and perplexity searches and so on on on what Gothic is and I figured let's go a little bit deeper into some of these links and see what others said about it the connection to art history archive is not secure we're going for it gothicism and Romanticism in William Blake by Michael slum the gothic style influenced both the art and the literature of the Romantic Period by presenting experience in a light of hard and depressing work presenting experience in a light of hard and depressing work this shows the strongest through the poet and painter William Blake in such articles and painting as Songs of Innocence The Chimney Sweeper weep weep weep the CLA and the pebble and through the paintings and writings in his books of Arison if anything William Blake used the ideas of death and God along with several thoughts on the failures of love and Imagination in today's society and he wrote them through the gothic style of darkness and bitter despair that is usually born of contempt for for people or Society itself innocence in experience Blake's next Target proved to be the most debatable and sometimes offensive topic of all God Blake decided he was going to write a series of stories about the formation of the world and the higher Powers involved this series is known as the books of Arizon Arizon is Blake's interpretation of God where he portrays the mighty Creator as an ultimate power that is chained to its miserable involvement with man wow and also like one's reading of that but then that's already okay is it really that way for Blake or is it for arttory archive.com writer and then what what about ours it clearly evident that Blake was definitely definitively influenced by the gothic style even though he wrote In the period of Romanticism okay open that okay Lilith Gallery not secure continue William Blake may not fit into the role of what we consider to be a modern goth but his poetry and art about sex love religion and especially death marks him as a goth within the romanticist period of art life songs of experience the pessimistic contrary volume to the Songs of Innocence real timeline 1757 to 1827 timeline Dante looking at the pictures the illuminated Pages Blake and Gothic Blake's taste for the gothic period in Gothic style began early when he set himself to copying prints of Masters body of Edward I one 1774 Gothic is living form annotations of books inscriptions like captions for figures public addresses public addresses vision of last judgment okay moving to the Blake math Edge so on the top right as upcycle has also written in the chat now I have four-fold Vision SE and a four-fold vision is given to me is four-fold in my Supreme delight and threefold in soft beula's light night and twofold always May goddess keep from single vision and Newton sleep okay from a letter and also to so many other uses this four-fold six liner and other times that Newton's vision and so on Newton's sleep is invoked in other works is in one reading contextualizing how Blake sees science and formality as a certain kind kind of limited and Powerful system analogous to for example geometry So within a space of geometry for example like a curve inside of an equilateral triangle and this kind of scroll unfolding and also as as Hector brought up [Music] um nature at the back and this Grecian mathem itical Gothic form in contrast and juxtoposition with like the fascination of man and the symbolic and the programming and a single Vision amidst what's happening Hector was talking about that I don't think on live stream maybe separately some quotes from this skilman address okay some explanation is necessary for why the presidential address begins with that purple boxed section Blake according to one of his most Ardent modern admirers and interpreters the Contemporary American poet Robert BL equated single vision and Newton sleep with a sense of poverty of the spirit a limited Vision a one-dimensional narrow Vision something that a person of age 20 or 22 might have although a two or three old not yet mired down by society's heavy hands of Conformity frequently see in double or even triple Vision Newton's world the world of only seeing what is there was interpreted by Blake as a world of pure scientific objectivity and therefore a dead World blly points out that Blake probably would be astonished to find out that subatomic particles don't always behave according to Newton's laws of physics the quantum Blake crossover alluded to Blake names this onedimensional Vision Olo for a vascular surgeon Olo might represent the feeling you have towards the editors of the Journal of vascular surgery when the best paper you ever wrote is unceremoniously rejected and is accompanied by three pages of single spaced comments vilifying every brilliant conclusion you reached olad represents the lowest State of Consciousness interpreted by blly to be the equival of narcissistic cold and Abstract hatred something he equates with eating at McDonald's where there's no obvious relationship between the blow on the head that kills the steer and the eating of the hamburger with special sauce or perhaps a committee meeting in which the agenda is only to see it my way probably the most participants in the politics of Hospital mergers find that their self-interest sucks them into the single Vision state of oo wow interesting lines very dark Academia Gothic Academia with the the journal um another angle to look at this rather than just only like a contextualized or reduced or specially crafted singular motiv vision is in terms of technique like capacity or like technology um and then another angle alluding to what could be a fun future math art or artstream kandinsky's work point and line to plane and thinking about different progressions and constructivist approaches to Geometry what is taken as aaic for example in this classical geometry the flatness and the the open-endedness and the infinite nature of the plane was is part of the setup that's where statements like two lines would and and could if you really drew them continue without intersecting parallell and then that's not true like on the surface of a sphere but it's a Axiom that helps align maps and territories with the inscription on a plane like from there commonly it's discussed as a building of the dimensions to get to the flatness where the geometry of the tracing exists and then from there into that space of closure like by adding whether the point is onedimensional or Zero Dimensional and then it goes 1 2 3 4 or whether this shape is called 3D and then it's 0 1 2 3 another approach starts with this geometry of lumps that's related to synergetics 4D that was an earlier math art stream with Kirby the growth in D site sit like an extended locus of even what could be at its kernel z d 1D type Point abstraction Shana's evocative and math art full methods with the in Infinity fying things the sheaths the diamonds these approaches in common give a way to structure the one as always already composite which approximately maybe even permanently has certain tensions it's another way to go at it with four constituting a one like Blake four Mighty ones are in every man SL everything one this is another axiomatic starting point but axioms were made and abided by up here so what is this alternative and what under what are those also part of a common set so that was the interesting geometric ways to contextualize which is also like kind of the Paradox of this Newton art piece is like but just looking at this might not yield the vision of perspective of this but the same could be said of any where to look or how to look okay oh this is from the the book chapters of William Blake's Gothic imagination bodies of horror let's just read the titles front matter introduction chapter 1 living form chapter 2 the hor of Rahab chapter 3 the gothic Sublime chapter 4 Dark Angels chapter 5 William Blake's monstrous progeny chapter 6 Blake's Gothic humor chapter 7 the horrors of creation chapter eight female spaces and the gothic imagination in the book of th and visions of the daughters of albon chapter nine the horrors of subjectivity the Jance of imminence chapter 10 Terri Thunders and enormous Joys bibliography index okay all right this is from Blake quarterly winter 2005/6 Blake's resolution to the war between science and philosophy Harry white as our understanding of Blake has progressed from madman to Mystic to Visionary artists there is still a widespread tendency to read him as holding anti-scientific views expressing strong anti-scientific sentiments and being unflagging in his exploration of anti-scientific doctrines with the meta ironic citation to those playing that single game if Blake hated and feared science how explained the fact that he believed the praval state of man was wisdom Art and Science and that the very last line of the four zoas proclaims that a future wherein the dark religions are departed in sweet science Reigns for after all is said and done what is the life of man but Art and Science okay just skipping to some random Parts Hume had demonstrated that the nature of mathematical principles and all other rational truths is that they are discoverable without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe and Blake was utterly Relentless in discrediting any and all claims that what he called the truth that that what he called Truth the results of reasoning could and did exist anywhere in the universe placing reason's unreal forms in Olo the void outside of existence Blake's response to the claims of natural philosophy was to draw a clear line of distinction between knowledge of existence and The Logical relations of abstract ideas every self-evident self-evident truth is one thing and Truth the result of reasoning is another thing annotations to bacon he was very much an empiricist to the extent that he believed the true faculty of knowing must be the faculty Which experiences and that knowledge is immediate by perception or sense at once foraging the inactive Markov blanket perception ecological psychology questions while he recognized that there may be General truths of reason he could not accept that there is such a thing as general knowledge since all knowledge as distinguished from General truths of region is particular because all things we experience are particular and unless you consult particulars you cannot even know or see anything annotations Reynolds wow what a great line I think one one way to connect this with generalizations and discussion of like general knowledge general intelligence or something like that is like let's say you knew something about all the counties in their particulars then you might have another fact that you might trust 100% or you could have another precision and so on attention to all this but there's another fact like the average the mean the variance across those facts so that becomes an analytic data processing fact again one that could be treated lightly but is that a generalized knowledge or is it a projected constructed knowledge in relationship to the prior facts measurements observations from like each of the counties so it's not general knowledge if it's like just about a bigger volume of space or time so then what is really General is it the transferable patterns across situations but those structural causal dynamical models they are also particular taken together the annotations to Berkeley and Reynolds give us a good idea of the limitations Blakes ought to impose on knowledge simply put knowledge is immediate and particular very related to Bucky Fuller focus on immediate perception allegory being his poor vision as a child before getting the glasses and finding the T as the minimal space enclosed and asking about the chalk on on the board also being composed of small lumps kind of like friston with the wood lice when he was eight any deductions of the reasoning faculty whether they are conducted prior to experience pure speculative reasoning possibly the contian synthetic a priori generative model prior state or even after the immediate sense or perception of things inductive reasoning possibly even abductive or alternative types of reasoning do not qualify as knowledge they represent truths of reason but such truths never give us knowledge of experience starting a parentheses and ending it with a or a sentence with a parenthese we will continue to examine Blake's distinction between truth and knowledge throughout the upcoming discussion wow when Blake insisted that mental things are alone real The crucial distinction is not fundamentally or simply between the mental and the physical but between the reality of the things we know and see and the non entities of which we have neither experience nor knowledge observables known unknowns Etc long a publication with great articles let's go to the end in the end I hope this essay has shown that for all that's been written to explain and celebrate Blake as a Mystic or Visionary he was a child of the Enlightenment who sought as to Define his thinkers of the age to free men from their numerous mind forg manacles London which served only to hinder Art and Science whose work believe form the basis of any good Society Blake examined ancient and modern conceptions of the truths of reason to show that rational truths were neither true nor false with respect to all those images of Truth we experience and anyone who claimed that they were true in that sense was speaking falsely since there was no foundation in experience for any such belief or claim on the other hand everything that humans do experience is true has to be true and cannot possibly be untrue no one no philosopher nor king or priest has any right to reject or condemn anything humans experience as being false or wrong for everything that lives is Holy visions of the daughters of albon wow interesting article some of the other ones not sure if will go as much into each of them can art canart instruct science William Blake as biological Visionary I just need to slightly crop the wow as the true method of knowledge is experiment the true faculty of knowing must be the faculty Which experiences perhaps related with pragmatism operationalism empiricism SE thou the little winged fly smaller than a grain of sand it has a heart like the a brain open to Heaven and Hell evolutionary looking at the dropa organs energy is the only life and is from the body energy is eternal Delight this is a cool post Blake used in a new way the things that were available in his culture to reveal the process of creation on on all its levels he can he consciously used language in a new way to free the reader from stereotypes of conventional language his methods are relevant as he knew they would be for other times and situations okay Romanticism on the net number 76 spring 21 fers globul cells William Blake and the biological individual Tera Lee scientific discoveries have often been preceded by shifts in ways of seeing this article argues that William Blake's critique of 18th century medicine is grounded upon a romantic view of organic form shared by contemporary science such as Loren Oaken 18th century anatomist and microscopists sought to isolate the elementary unit of living matter which was thought to be the five fiber by some and the globu by others at the beginning of the 19th century however scientists began to question the assumption that a living organism was an AG glomeration of Parts framing the individual part as something produced only by the division and Analysis of the whole in doing so they set the terms for the development of modern cell theory in the 1830s Blake's evocative descriptions of the fibers and globules which make up living organisms show him undermining the reductionist search for a fundamental unit of life however an artist rather than a biologist Blake is also able to use a metaphorical language of graphical form to challenge his readers to see individuality as a matter of perspective rather than a matter of fact ultimately helping to craft the epistemic environment that would make later theories of the organism possible every eye sees differently as the ey such the object annotation okay let's read some random section of this document which is 29 pages long as Ken Gilham writes the history of the concept of the cell is inseparable from the history of the concept of the individual and for Blake biological atomism is a form of reductive single Vision how you identify the individual is largely a matter of perspective when distant for example individuals appear as one man but as you approach them they appear multitudes of Nations geometry of lumps as Blake writes in his description of a vision of the last judgment similarly the nation can resolve into men and women the human body can resolve into fibers and globules and Beyond this scale the world opens slash into eternity as his artistic practices show however the scale at which Humanity primarily dwells in Blake's mind is at the level of the whole human body though Blake engages with both fiber Theory and glob theory he ultimately criticizes both in order to take an organismic view towards biological individuality very related to the question of what is the organism ant is the colony the organism or is the colony the super organism which implies that the organism would be the nestmate there's are only two of them anyways to see it let's go to a lat section here we have the image of above the local textures of a vibrantly material world are thus evoked using a printing technique which invites the touch of the alator the artist's work is to bring this modeled world into form organizing it into something resembling his original conception through the precise use of pen and ink in contrast the abstracting natural philosopher turns away from the material world altogether choosing rather to produce a world of clean geometric lines on white paper meanwhile inspired by the discovery that the skin was a composite of several entangled strata of woven woven fibers other printers in the 18th century were developing Innovative color printing techniques to build accurate flesh tones layering several layers of cross-hatching in various primary colors on top of each other in order to render the subtle tones of living skin but Blake's decision to work in relief etching precludes the possibility of producing complicated cross-hatching notable exceptions in Blakes illuminated books include the white line Engravings of Milton condensing all his fibers Blake overwhelmingly privileges the outline over the constitutive threads of the flesh what an incredible Point here Milton is bringing the fibers together so it is a single trace and it's nonoverlapping and those are representing fibers but but if you zoom in then we can think about this form human form as identified by its wiry bounding line not by the fact that for example if you zoomed in there would be a level of zoom in where whether of the digital photo or of the actual there would be ambiguity like oh what about the microbiome or what about once we get down down to the the electrons on the surface of the skin and all these kinds of softnesses and and ambiguities that arise at reduced scales which are then clarified into wiry bounding lines of like okay well then what is it or that's what was alluded to also in the address about Blake and the post neonian Quantum and Quantum active inference type cognitive science where it's like well actually whether this is actual or actually our empirical status it is more field likee so even if you get to well all the things that are playing a causal role for the organism are going to constitute part of it so simple then the micro mic microbiome is or it's the ones that have uh closer than not genetic relatedness to this kind of cell then you get a different kind of partition but you also made the choice of which partition to take so pretty interesting about that we'll look at one more section one of Blake's most famous images is the globul of blood in the pulsation of the artery the passage appears in Milton with within a discussion of the relationship between eternity and Earthly Time Eternity is in production is in love with the production of time something like that collapsing ing the moment in the Aon Blake compares the minute minute globule to gigantic Celestial Globes the moment is pregnant with potential it is where time is conceived every time less than a pulsation of the artery is equal in its period and value to 6,000 years for in this period the poet's work is done and all the great events of Time start forth and are conceived in such a period within a moment a pulsation of the artery so many ways to go with this biological rhythms the duty cycle whether it's a pulsation of an artery like a fmri bold or whether it has to do with other Cycles like EEG time scale this is like the agent construction of time and space so that connects also to the kind of agentic deployment of quantum reference frames the microscope knows not of this nor the telescope they alter the ratio of the spectator's organ but leave objects untouched for every space larger than a red globule of man's blood is visionary and is created by the hammer of Los and every space smaller than a globi of man's blood opens into eternity of which this vegetable Earth is but a shadow interesting like to look with eye on a microscope or or a representation created by a microscope is a a minute particular so even though it might be understood also in another way where it represents ambiguity about for example the actual shape or uh reflection of a surface there's another scientific empiricist reading that it's also an actual and then hinting that space is smaller than some kind of planks uh length type opens into eternity of which this vegetable Earth is but a shadow so it's above that it's corpuscular that's where you get Newtonian classic baseball going on the parabola Dynamics but it actually links very interestingly to the the open-endedness of down the road of reductionism and even searching for smaller things life operates both beneath and above the scale of the global to know something is not to merely see it but also to touch it to involve oneself with it intimately and haptically that that connects to the active inference concept scale-free approach to to active engagement sensing and then also invokes this intimacy and the caring aboutness which shenana discussed with a kir guard okay okay this was just alluded to I do have cursor open so we can look at the scripts for a a brief interlude okay in systems William Blake how to use super Maven another coding thing opening up the uh folder running Blake mentions but first we'll look at it Target terms mathematical mathematics science and time if someone writes a suggestion then I'll add more terms but we already made these files so let's look up some new ones let's do Gothic goth interesting suggestions and active inference inferential sure now nine mentions for Gothic one for goth eight for active goth not nor not Goths nor monks Blake Gothic mentions Gothic is living form some of these we've looked at also some other ones active marriage in Heaven and Hell nor in pity false nor in officious Brotherhood where none needs be active meantime palam's horses raged with thick Flames redundant and the herrow maddened with Fury wow the passive Idol sleep the enormous night and darkness of death set herself up to give her laws to the active masculine virtue this more from a Pros writing perhaps annotations the whole of the the new church is in the AC of life and not in ceremonies at all okay on to the last section so we'll look at some of the active inference links then check anyone's comments or questions this image was to represent let me recrop the image was to represent the four as one and two as one to in opposition defraculator to another there's probably a lot of other ways to like add different funny things but just could could show a lot of representations like that okay Blake and the particular partition previously we saw a foress related to ways of knowing SL states of being Newton sleep Etc there are many other aspects and four-fold concordances in Blake for example tetrahedra tetrahedral pneumonics are used verbatim and structurally to summarize systems physical and cognitive in terms of a unified wall compositional geometric NE uh nature part of the composability that's actual and and even further directions that are possible is making a one always already compositional sets up for multiscale mapping and scale friendliness in a different way whereas with one as monad always then it's stepping out into the open with the engineering of even two or three or however many so for as one A different axiomatic position or stance to take gives a different kind of composability when even inert systems are especially those in observation like poly computation even inertness can be seen as multiple and there there could also be an a these are just some schemes just with a with a zero value or something okay how could this connect with the four-fold particular partition in the free energy principle and how could it connect with other four-way partitions here it goes to Theory translator some work by Andreas and there are three Minds in this wondrous wisdom approach acting on null sum 1 2 3 4 5 six and seven sums and some of the active inference terms have been brought in here's mine behavior and brain alluded to in the in the title of the 2022 textbook so interesting to think about what what if this kind of four-way four-fold this concordance what is the real meaning or value or implication of any kind of numerical concordance or or difference like oh here for this seemingly identical function or set or process here it's split up into five here it's three or here it's five and here it's five or what does it mean that this fourfold is explaining or accounting or mapping this and then this one is mapping to this are these what so in the free energy principle especially following on from 2019 Carl friston's book book length plus plus plus plus work a free energy principle for a particular physics and it was awesome Maxwell also organized a reading group that that brought in a lot of important comments and this 2009 paper of which hasn't been versioned on archive it's like the work has just continued in so many other ways that it wasn't really just to improve this one but like all the other papers this one's interesting to see where and how it was stated and then look also at the basy mechanics all the recent things since 2022 Etc so just scrolling through it and let's just see all the things that are in it the image here is from uh later paper which is the particular kinds paper let me recrop okay the particular petition which is an axiomatic midpoint or and or beginning for f on the high road is the pun is on particular it's both that one like that particular car and it's particularizing it's the step or the approximative step of making that geometry of lump like whether one thinks about it the real particulars minute particulars of that rock that constitute it as a territory in closed space within space or in the poly computation more more particularizing every perception has to include some kind of thingness about it being applied and and Blake from earlier weekend remember was seeing that as a gentic in its construction let's follow on the minute particulars like systems even diffus ones it's a classic question about well what about a tornado or what about this and and then a a turn to the empirical with what scale what measure what tolerance and the blanket index and other approaches that allow shifting and uh more complexly varied interfaces minute particulars in the Visionary labor of words Julie Jon Blakes Jerusalem the emation of the giant albon presses the idea of minute particulars discreet significant units of sound and meaning Los works with such materials to build a system of signification signification and reading that answers the blinking imperative labor well the minute particulars attend to the little ones this paper considers how minute particulars expose the dumb embedded structures that produce albon's Melancholy and it explores how Jerusalem resists dumb despair by creating a counter melancholic Poetics that figures minute particulars as both the symptoms of and cure for albon's melancholy as the smallest units of sound and meaning minute particulars are essential to Blake's production of a liberated Poetics for he who wished to see a vision a perfect hole must see it in its minute particulars no General Vision in the second chapter of Jerusalem the emanation of joh Alon as Los and albon's friends the cities of England attempt to call albon back from his Melancholy the self-conscious voice of the poet comments on the language Los uses to describe the friends I call them by their English names English the rough basement Los built the stubborn structures of the language acting against albon's Melancholy who must else have been a dumb despair Los focuses on building the structure or formal conditions of language as a response to Alban's Melancholy he produces a syntax and grammar whose stubborn structure resists the dumb restraints of Alan's despair English emerges both as cure and challenge to alon's Melancholy can how can Blake be translated minute particular itself embodies the concentrated multivalent nature of minute particulars minute minute is an adjective modifying particular but it exceeds its role as adjective by performing the diversity of the idea it designates minute Rises up and takes on its other grammatical forms according to the Oxford English Dictionary by 1820 the year of Jerusalem's completion minute my as adjective could mean exacting discriminating chopped and small as a noun it resonates as a short space of time a 60th of an hour a point of time the fitted moment a brief summary of events an official memorandum authorizing a certain course an agreement or precise understanding and in music a usually improvised ornamentation whereby a long note is replaced by a series of shorter one as a verb minute can mean to draft record or enumerate Point by Point each of these definitions introduces a compelling reading of minute and an account begins to emerge that reveals the minute particularity of minute minute Becomes of a small chop discret moment that replaces larger or longer moments in time a moment appointed to offer a precise prophetic understanding recorded in its inscription super interesting very related to the infinity time caner dust and time time as dust and the dream state and the different paths amongst the dust points and also running whether it's a continuous time or a discrete time model on digital Hardware there is this like discretization so it's like is the CPU frequency the pulsation of the artery if that's this small chopped discret momentz and then sequences of those become representing and replacing larger moments particular takes up and complicates the concepts of Minute by 1820 the OED notes definitions of particular that include accounts of belonging of or belonging to someone thing and not to any others special not General proper peculiar restricted apart from the rest distinguished in some way among others of the kind it implies forms of Distinction with its definitions more than ordinary peculiar so as to excite surprise or wonder strange odd and in Practical terms particular means describing or setting forth something in detail of a narrative account Etc attention to details of action especially careful Blake offers two forms of production for the minute particular and attempts to discriminate between them # low road High Road between the hardened particularity that condenses meaning and the wildly exact particularity of a poetic language that holds various meanings simultaneously Los identifies the former minute particular it in Alban's Fallen body in the poem's terms the atom that lock and Newton imagine structures the universe is a wheel without wheel a Loc isolated atom that builds on other atoms literally bruising minute articulations through the forces of their compulsions that form the physical world for Blake Newton's atom is the threat of reduction realized it is the component part that contains only a small hard meaning a limited compulsion minute articulation offers an alter alternative alternate version of production to the Newtonian atom it is Wheels within Wheels a revolving harmonious structure reminiscent of the medieval cosmology of Crystal spheres Cosmic hierarchy each wheel is contingent on the next all are necessary to each other and the harmony of their revolutions produces Celestial music if the threat of minute particulars is that they might Harden into Newtonian atoms then their ambition is to recover or produce a vision of an edenic world order that is apocalyptic in consequence past present and future exist all at once in the wheels of its minute articulation but the reader encounters Jerusalem sequentially plate by plate and the trajectory of the prophecy can be traced temporally within specific moments landmarking the narrative's progression the methods of marking time are albon's progressive Falls this new conception of time allows the poem to open out unexpectedly a apparently the apocalypse occurs in the text and is sounded by the minute particular time was finished yet the poem continues Jerusalem literally cannot be contained within the traditional organization of narrative and syntax it exceeds those structures but how can a narrative exist outside of its rhetorical structures how can the text continue its narrative trajectory when that movement is not grounded in temporality that the poem is not only concerned with time in terms of a linear progression but also with it as an aspect of Rhythm reveals the work structural interest in time as a disrupting force of time in a moment of self-reflexivity time apprehends itself and interrupts the temporal unfolding of narrative the seams of the work become visible at the poem's outset the narrator says when this verse was first dictated to me I can Ed a monotonous monotonous Cadence like that used by Milton or Shakespeare and all writers of English blank verse derived from the modern bondage of rhyming to be a necessary and indispensable part of verse but I soon found that in the mouth of a true oror such monotony was not only awkward but as much as a bondage as rhyme itself I therefore have produced a variety in every line both of cadences and number of syllables nice okay two Blake and cognition upcycle Club wrote dun scotus concept of hity thisness might be relevant to this particular partition thank you upcycle okay here finding this was like wow just how how many insights along the way and in these high density formats just on the Blake topic wow was William Blake the first neuroscientist in mcgilchrist 18th of February 2015 the title page should we sign up for the mailing list let's not do it the title page of Blake's great prophetic book Orizon Bears the caption which is the way the right or the left what did he mean Blake is full of contraries both in his poetry and his life perhaps only NRA is harder to talk about without contradicting oneself such interesting angle to go down to indeed Blake it was who said that without contraries there is no progression a Visionary poet whose imagination was enormously rich and unconventional he seems to have had an intuitive awareness of the functioning of his own brain as possibly did Milton from whom Blake learned so much in particular Blake seems to have been aware of the conflict between two ways of conceiving the world which are now known to be associated with the cerebral hemispheres classic Migel Christ move this is something that Blake scholar rodri tweet and I have written about separately without knowing of one another's work great all the better all the cooler for the idea he from the standpoint of Blake scholarship seeing the connections with brain lateralization and I from the standpoint of Neuroscience seeing the connections with Blake his book is called the god of the left hemisphere and it is the best book on Blake that I know or expect ever to read High pragmatic value from Mill my book is called the master and his Emissary The Divided brain and the making of Western World okay not a long post so let's look at some other quotes oh it's a description of a lecture he is giving in that year the Blake Society annual lecture the infinite brain and the narrow Circle in Picadilly 7:30 p.m. the lecture will contain Reflections on what Blake can teach us about such topics as phenomenology the mindbody relationship the relationship between the particular and the general and even the nature of time and Infinity but it will also aim to celebrate this most amazing poet's richness and variety the writer of some of the funniest as well as of the most disturbing poetry in the English language okay Blake and the mark of the cognitive notes towards the appearance of the skeptical subject this essay seeks to understand the implications of the distribution of cognition acoss Ross the arbitrary boundary of skull and skin into the environment so that cognition can be partially partly offloaded onto the environment and in doing so open up new areas of inquiry for distributed cognition such as subject object relations and skepticism it reframes William Blake's London so that we can look aresh at his speaker Blake's blurring of where inputs and outputs begin and end make him an ideal candidate for such an inquiry and he highlights the stiff price to be paid for all this cognitive efficiency the inability to distinguish between affordances and ideology wow control as policy coion mental affordances cognitive affordances which ideology to choose how William Blake's integral psychology reading Blake and Ken Wilbur together 2006 okay great connection to make both William Blake's poetry and Ken Wilbur's theory of integral psychology articulate a grand path of individual interrelational and Collective Awakening moving moving beyond one-dimensional caverns of habit convention and defense realizing the holy multi-dimensional nature of self others and world and responding with awareness wisdom love and Justice Blake embraced this great existential challenge with immense artistic and spiritual Integrity likewise each of us is called to explore the path directly Guided by Wilbur's model the article demonstrates that Blake created an integral all quadrant all level vision of existence and body of artwork Blake sought to cultivate well-being in all levels of consciousness Body Mind Soul and Spirit and in relationships with others culture Society community and nature by presenting an integral psychological interpretation of Blake's art and a Blake inspired exploration of Wilbur's Theory back and forth the present work Endeavors to foster a deeper appreciation of both okay quadrant model Wilbur 2000 figure 51 same six lines energy is eternal Delight fibers in the brain to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold Infinity in the palm of your hand and Eternity in an hour if the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is infinite and that is a famous affirmation William Blake in the metaverse mental fight to be a person opening the doors of perception using William Blake's writing to enhance student understanding of cognition that one's linked here and from out the portals of my brain 2024 this year how about opening the doors of PDF downloading opportunities good thing there's a button Westchester PA introduction while psychology and psychological concepts are frequently employed in the teaching of literature in college classrooms it is much less common for literature to be used in the teaching of psychology stim the problem the author has experienced success in using literature in the teaching of educational psychology the writings of William Blake provide a promising resource for use this way literature review limited resources exist on the use of literature and psychology classes nevertheless some benefits have been proposed and or documented teaching implications the major part of this article consists of specific applications of William Blake in the educational psychology classroom a sample lesson plan is also provided conclusion the suggestions outlined in this article provide a basis for others to design and investigate Innovative uses of literature in educational psychology classes cognition and cognitive development in the writings of William Blake again so great that so many of the big connections have just already been made constructivism developmental doors of perception another interpretive approach to the doors of perception Passage would be to discuss what many Educators in research have viewed as an overemphasis on rational linguistic thinking in schools in other words as teachers focus on specific EG as represented on standardized test subject matter particularly in language arts and math they may contribute to a further blocking up of the doors of perception this has effect of limiting other non-tested modes and styles of thought that might enhance perception open the doors including creative and imaginative thinking Collaborative Learning and physical Hands-On activity in the real world using Blakes World words as a springboard students could be asked to describe aspects of their own schooling that may have closed doors on their own perceptual experience while this passage may seem somewhat obscure it could be a rich source for discussing stages of cognitive processing and more specifically the causes and consequences of failures to process information at those stages for example students could infer to what Blake was referring to when he wrote the senses inward Rush shrinking beneath the dark net of infection also students could be asked to connect the following phrases with cognition and information processing shrunken eyes clouded over no more could they rise at will in the infinite void bound down to Earth by their narrowing perceptions information processing models attention acts as a filter that selects and filters incoming data the filtering process can result in attenion and ultimately perception that is limited by prior experience or selective bias focusing on some perceptual data at the expense of other information presented in the sensory field attentional limitations classic grain of sand brain belief doubt okay 75 minute class session could be a ton of fun we could generate many as well with language models and site this Pape in every single one the three main objectives of this introductionary lesson are to introduce the information processing model of human memory and learning to facilitate student understanding by connecting elements of the information processing model with selected passages from the writing of William Blake to encourage students to relate information processing Theory to their own experiences as Learners and platform that allows for public posting and commenting will suffice okay memory culminating activity okay and then here's the 2024 one from out the portals of my brain William Blake's partis mentis birth of the mind and imaginative regeneration anaisa vulon uni pg. partis mentis the partian of the Mind brings together the following two significant aspects of Roman culture and ideology the exploration into human generation and the process of how imagination forms an idea and makes the Mind creatively productive generation of Mind and Body this article suggests that analyzing William Blake's portrayal of imagination through the partis mentis Trope can enhance our comprehension of how he illustrates and employs this faculty in his works in Blake's partis menus the analogy between the brain and the womb is pivotal the brain is seen as a host for ideas that are conceived through imagination and once they are brought to life in minute particulars they become art this is a vital component of Blake's cosmogeny tying into his personal reinterpretation of biblical Genesis and his concept of the human form Divine it also includes his response to Medical theories and practices regarding generation and life possibly in science this article pays close attention to the medical cultural discourse that was contemporary to Blake and its wide use of the analogy which defined the epistem of the long 18th century the analogy approach was later challenged by the epistemology of the visual # mcluhan which emphasized the use of anatomical atlases while wax models and dissections for direct experiential insights into bodily functions and processes particularly of the brain in the womb this article argues that Blake is able to transcend these two epistemologies while harnessing specific elements from each so as analogy and as visual let's just skip to some random part Globes atoms the expressions of emotion and physical Sensations I wish and feel and weep and grown May reflect the basic instinctual responses of a developing fetus its Silent Communication with the world outside the womb the repetition of terrible appears to be an acknowledgement of the profound and daunting yet all inspiring nature of love life's beginning the formidable process of creation that starts within the womb interestingly thorus parent power condition in the four zoas is both physical and mental the reality he describes appears to be not only an actual physical transformation but also a mental construct akin to aartis mentis from the pregnant body to the pregnant mind from his early illuminated books Blake depicts the human body in the context of generation this is reflected in how imagination can uncover the essence of things and thereby produce ideas in the mind it also applies to how the characters in his mythology are created in a physically tangible yet profoundly intellectual manner okay Kirby wrote in between there are doors lots of fascination with Lial spaces where comes from doorway or portal as I have mentioned the nameless shadowy female presents an instance of Paris menus one of the few performed by a female being in plate 5 of Europe she was portrayed in a pose similar to loses during anan's birth with her hands gripping her head further down her flowing hair there is a wom likee shape which encloses a contracted male figure the figure is reminition of Leonardo's studies on the fetus and likely represents the secret child mentioned in the textual component of the plate William Blake demonstrates an intense and profound interest in the outcomes of Life Sciences including the study of obstetric a field that was only just beginning to manifest its potential during his time however Blake's perceptions and beliefs about generation and birth deviated from the traditional view uhoh he did not confine these phenomena to the single event of a baby's delivery instead he transcended it through partis mentis which involves the dynamic and transformative activity of imagination viewing generation or to be more precise regeneration as a repeated process occurring multiple times throughout an individual's life this process was integrally linked Ken Wilbur integral to the discovery of the human form divine in the Gutenberg Galaxy muhan reformulates let's just go to the link another insecure link we'll do it wow wow expired domain light through mcluhan is gone but it literally wasn't how important a reminder about our cing in the Gutenberg like every one of these links we could have the mega download I I would love to work on anyone with setting up those kinds of Pathways like every link we should just download the video save the page in multiple formats Etc so I'd be happy to explored that with anyone in the Gutenberg galaxy mcluhan reformulates in the uralian to concept of the census communist in terms of a sense ratio common sense a concept ostensibly adopted from William Blake quoting from Blake's poem Jerusalem emanation of the giant albon written 1804 to 1820 mcluhan asserts that Blake is concerned with a changing patterns of human perception he says that Blake's theme is captured in these lines from book two chapter 34 of the poem If the per if perceptive organs vary objects of perception seem to vary if the perceptive organs close their objects seem to close also so there's the direct visual perception apprehension of thingness like I'm looking at a pen on my desk closing my eyes I might have a semantic or phonological Loop or semantic or implicit or any other kind of these memories procedural about the pen being on the table however it would not be the same as the immediate Visual and that's the visual epistemology that was hinted at in the medical setting and then there's the analogical it's like well the visual is just it is what it is things are as they seem to be or is it things are like they seem to be and then it's a simile then that goes into the analogical OR I see this is that already a metaphor with a silent whereas the simile at least announces its present in the sort of Californian like way but the metaphor doesn't okay then here was the third blakean part this will be the last of the prepared sections on Blake and then I'll look again for anyone's comments or or questions or anything like that okay so this is from drawing on narrative Unbound which is a 1987 book by Donald Alt and there's even more layers of reviews and discussion since this it was seemingly like a momentous moment for the the Blake scholarship fractal um these are just some of the images on the page that that represent different visualizations and and bracketing within bracketing different um representations of flows that that happen on different dimensions and then it was just to fun and too spatially actually close to this pair of books by Shana which are also Fantastical with math art and speak to sort of what if um category Theory or this kind of writing was like remove the labels from this cleanse cleanse the labels remove the quote language the non diagrammatic parts and then it's like there it is that's the space of stories that this is in reference to this is that diagram for that space of stories but it was a forensic anatomical work one might even say and and it's played with in so many ways in the book itself with like was Blake just building another system how is the co-construction of the of the reader and the text part of its own Unity is plural and at minimum to that helps resolve and throwing the read reader deeper into the dialectic between conscious and unconscious linear and embedding meeting so in the diagrams of category Theory which one could imagine doing category theoretic uh representations or any other kind of symbolic representations narrative information management and all that of works now some Works might have a rocketing structure or a a narrative information environment that looks like a freeway or some might have whatever it happens to be but the kinds of movies that I often hear people talking about include like structurally interesting elements it's it's not all it's its own genre and it it often adds though probably for some it can dist it can distract but it's like another structural level that that the scientific paper provides for example but should it matter what order it's in well then it's like well should it matter what order the words are in I mean or the letters and then it's opening up into well what are those conditions and constraints and all of that of that constructed system the the syntax and the semantics and and that Paradox that there is a linear SE quence to the plates of these works so how can something within a linear system within a digital system for example also have this unity's plural at minimum multiple character so yeah this was just funny just just getting some um local carpet um representations but here's active inference book for scale mirror and then it was just like there's so many ways to pull out quotes from this book but just found it super interesting that only only 10 pages in which is the page uh that we'll focus on for this part dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot the discrepancy between the two textual facts and interpret it as a subjective error on the part of the reader or the narrator in this latter case the radical for zoa's narrative fails to come into existence at all and the text exists as an inner nest of paradoxes mistakes and non seiters any reader who is able to perceive a text as though it were itself undergoing Transformations dissolving fixed facts in the receding narrative and allowing the past to be reenacted and revised has already been initiated into Blake's perspective drama the reader who resists Blake's text and anxiously clings to the security of one of the fundamental elements of a pre-existing underlying World a privileged originating event a primal rupture or fall refuses to acknowledge that the fall or rupture actually comes into existence through the reader failed imaginative judgment in the face of radical discrepancies and does not lie before or beneath the text see below the possibility that the four zoa's narrative will be denied existence by the resistive reader will they look at it in that single vision so that it seems like what about Ulisses or all these other finegan wake all these kinds of infinite Gest like literatures and will they be seen as unable to escape their own entrapment or or unable to make a point because it kind of does something that's like oh yeah okay I get what they're doing but I get what they're doing and they're doing something fixed and then here in pencil agree possibly underlined as well but why go on question mark they're like I mean aren't I already like reading this video or watching this live stream and having not just Newton's single Vision like why would I go on in the poem or is it why would I keep reading this book so if they think they've already been initiated into Blake's perspective drama then then but but why go on at all or like on the page or skip the next page or another book but there's it's a great physical copy of the book because it has these like multiple annotations and things like that then on the right side there's some interesting sections in quotes it's just it it's a it's heavy hitting with how incredible a lot of the Blake scholarship is like Technical and uh well uh expertised type writing in the humanities there is is the name space to enter but just taking it like okay the Gene's name is just like gfp Los is just okay Los is showing up again and again I I don't know gfp is showing up again and again there's an element of like namespace initiation to reduce the discrepancy it's like well I haven't heard that name around me or I haven't seen that term before it's like well it's being used in this kind of frequency and way and context it's like it just is in that situation so that a sort of light cognitively light reading strategy whereas it's pointing out that the kind of cognitive effort that would be associated with like trying to go especially like on your first reading to go through and like plow and be like but what what is meant by this like that doesn't make sense giv this or I don't understand why this is following that it's like there's an element of just the experience both capturing and all also being failing to be captured with readings that are sort of like mixed and if the inclination is to see things as as a before happening before and after or something like that then that ruler gets deployed onto the narrative so then but maybe it's okay to be entertained within or or distracted or something within the single Vision however Al does an incredible repeated job with pulling out that that is not the kind of reading that the reference ironically or or nobly or however that relationship is seen is pointing towards which is about the holding of a linear and embedded timel lights because it rules out the existence of a pre-fabricated world that acts as a mysterious substratum of the text akin to the I know not what of locken berley perspective transformation argues that whatever underlying world or deep structure the poem could possibly exhibit must come into existence in the process of being narrated the operation of this generative process # generative process generative model imposes on Blake's narrative field a severe restriction the Primacy of narrative sequential order that dictates that the order in which characters appear and events occur is a primary feature of their reality structural reading this narrative requirement in part accounts for the intensity of Blake's obsession with rearranging inserting and deleting segments of the four zoas which is just another amazing twist which is kind of like what if it was the whole edit history for a GitHub repo or code repo or manuscript or something all these edges and additions and deletions then that becomes its own hyperobjects which can give readings and interpretations of those Dynamics like let's just say that there was a book and the main plot item was like things were a certain way and then they were 10x more so then that code base or that manuscript could have like been small and then 10x more so be like oh it was about with this structural and semantic Harmony or it could be a contrast like oh that's kind of the irony is like it expanded 10x and then it stayed the same size and it was edited from there or oh it's a linear or oh it overshot and then it reduced actually but then there's also that extractable internal semantics of things like going up by 10f perspective transformation operates on itself finally retroactive and projective perspective Transformations are structurally self-reflexive they operate not only on narrative details but also on themselves strange Loop GB by their very nature perspective Transformations have the power to modify the rules of the game at those junctures where the context of the narrative reaches a state of Crisis state of exception when one such Point occurs in night 7A in the context of the eating of the fruit of the tree of mystery where characters begin to become consciously aware that they are in a narrative world where it is possible to revise the past by reenacting it a process which previously had operated as an unconscious perspective analyses of events by The Narrative see below characters thus attempt consciously to undo prior events in night 7A under the guise of repentance and Contrition as if to subvert this emergence into consciousness of its own unconscious processes The Narrative begins generating branching alternative routes through which conflicting narrative possibilities of Prior events are realized conflicting narrative possibilities of Prior events are realized perspective transformation itself undergoes transformation by not only analyzing prior events but also simultaneously generating different and IR irreducibly incom measurable ways the same event actually happens enters into the narrative so happening meaning to enter into narrative but then in this sort of omni synergetic everything larger than a globule has an inside and outside geometry of cognitive lumps Etc that narrative information ecosystem has a gentic narrative sequentiality like would it be the same poem or work if I read the pages quote out of order what about analyzing the past in the present a tension between making the unconscious conscious and then and aspectual interconnection the fall as privileged event and pretext throughout the poem Blake distinguishes between two sources of information the constantly modulating voice the narrator and the spoken and probably goes on to say something like about how the spoken parts that are within the text so there's a narrator as as relator of the relationships of what's happening within the text that's like what makes it Psycho Drama so for four it was just empty I guess there's four dots um I will wait a minute if anyone writes a further live chat thank you upcycle and Kirby for joining yeah lot of interesting ways to proceed so so many ways to go into so much great learning from other post blakean work and and connections and it's like but it's like wow there's so many connections and possibilities to make it's is it about making what or is it just about to have been able to had kind of knowing she would from the beetle song Norwegian would well in the short term I will have into the next week lay the slides down now that it is uh streamed out and would look forward to people's comments or thoughts on it through whatever channel so thanks for watching slash listening and uh yeah how to quote ends okay bye
