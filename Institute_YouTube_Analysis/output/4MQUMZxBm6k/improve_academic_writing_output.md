As of September 8, 2024, this message serves as a follow-up on the personal channel regarding the Math Art Stream number eight, which took place two days ago on September 6, featuring Shanon, Hector, and Dean. The presentation slides are accessible at the provided link and within the video description. The video of Math Art Stream 8 is available for viewing.

The objective of this follow-up paper stream is to engage in further learning, reflection, and follow-up on certain quotes and links that were not included in the presentation. This revisitation aims to explore the implications and outcomes of the discussed content. Participants are encouraged to share comments or questions, which I will periodically address.

This discussion arises within the context of the Math Art Stream series, emphasizing the interplay between mathematics and art. The series features active inference and introduces a fourth vertex: William Blake. The inquiry considers Blake's perspectives on art and mathematics, as well as his whimsical interpretations. We will delve into Blake's views on mathematics and science, followed by an exploration of active inference.

The discussion will raise classical questions: What constitutes math art? Can we delineate between art and mathematics? What is the essence of active inference? Additionally, we will consider various terminologies, such as "active math art inference," and whether the definitions derive from process or outcome. Is the focus on the creation of an etching or the completion of the etching? Is it essential for the creator to be aware of the etching process? These inquiries lead to reflections on the conditions that categorize a work as art, such as whether the medium—pencil, pen, or robotic arm—determines its classification.

We begin with a review of William Blake's connection to art, as previously discussed in a 52 Living Ideas activity in January 2023. This context also includes comparisons with Buckminster Fuller, providing insights into Blake's productivity during his lifetime. The ongoing Blake scholarship, including the Blake Society and the Blake Archive, offers a wealth of resources.

During the Math Art Stream, we addressed the concept of Gothic art, prompting further examination of its implications within art history. The connection between Gothicism and Romanticism is evident in the works of William Blake, particularly in his poems and paintings, such as "Songs of Innocence" and "The Chimney Sweeper." Blake's exploration of themes such as death, God, and the failures of love and imagination is evident in his gothic style.

Blake's portrayal of God in the "Books of Urizen" presents a complex interpretation of divinity, illustrating a creator bound by its relationship with humanity. This perspective raises questions about Blake's view of the world and the role of artistic expression in conveying profound truths.

In examining Blake's influence on the Gothic style, we note that while he may not fit the modern definition of "goth," his exploration of sex, love, religion, and death aligns with Gothic themes within the Romantic period. The interplay between science and art in Blake's work presents a rich area for exploration, particularly in the context of Newton's vision and its limitations.

This inquiry into Blake's four-fold vision invites us to consider the implications of his views on science, art, and cognition. The tension between reason and experience, as articulated by Blake, prompts a reevaluation of the nature of knowledge and its relationship to existence.

The exploration of Blake's minute particulars reveals his engagement with the complexities of individual perception and the interconnectedness of knowledge and experience. Ultimately, this discussion seeks to illuminate the rich tapestry of Blake's thought and its relevance to contemporary inquiries in mathematics, art, and cognitive science.
