As of September 8, 2024, this document serves as a follow-up to the math art stream number eight, which took place two days ago on September 6, featuring participants Shannon, Hector, and Dean. The presentation slides are accessible via the provided link and in the video description, and the video of the math art stream eight is also available. The objective of this follow-up paper stream is to revisit and reflect on the discussion, as well as to address some quotes and links that were omitted from the original presentation. Participants are encouraged to share any comments or questions, which I will attempt to address periodically.

This discussion arises within the context of the math art stream series, emphasizing the intersection of mathematics and art, particularly in relation to the concept of active inference. In this context, we introduce William Blake as an additional vertex in this triad. The inquiry examines Blake's perspectives on art and how they relate to mathematics and science, as well as exploring the broader implications of these connections.

Central questions include: What defines math art? Can art and mathematics be distinctly separated? What constitutes active inference, and how do these concepts intersect? We will consider various terminologies, such as active math art inference, and whether these definitions are determined by process or outcome. Is the focus on the creation of an etching or the completion of the etching itself? Furthermore, we will explore whether certain materials, such as pencil or pen, inherently carry artistic value, and how the involvement of technology, such as robotic arms, influences this perception.

To engage with Blake's contributions to art, I previously discussed his productivity and historical context alongside Buckminster Fuller during a 52 Living Ideas activity in January 2023. This exploration revealed a vibrant culture of Blake scholarship, supported by institutions such as the Blake Society and the Blake Archive. We also aim to delve deeper into the notion of Gothic in art, examining its connections to the Romantic period through the works of Blake.

Michael Slater's analysis, "Gothicism and Romanticism in William Blake," posits that the Gothic style significantly influenced both art and literature during the Romantic era, reflecting experiences of despair and darkness. Blake's works, including "Songs of Innocence," "The Chimney Sweeper," and "The Pebble," illustrate his unique interpretation of themes such as death, love, and imagination within a Gothic framework.

Blake's perspective on God is also noteworthy; he endeavored to depict the divine as a power bound to its relationship with humanity. His writings challenge conventional notions of truth and knowledge, asserting that genuine understanding arises from direct experience rather than abstract reasoning. This aligns with his critique of Newtonian science, which he viewed as overly reductive.

Moving forward, we will investigate the implications of these ideas for understanding the relationship between mathematics, art, and cognition. We will also explore how Blake's insights can inform contemporary discussions in fields such as cognitive science and psychology, particularly regarding the nature of perception and the boundaries of knowledge.

In summary, this follow-up aims to engage participants in a thoughtful examination of Blake's contributions to art, the implications for mathematics, and the broader intersections of these disciplines, fostering an environment for dialogue and inquiry.
