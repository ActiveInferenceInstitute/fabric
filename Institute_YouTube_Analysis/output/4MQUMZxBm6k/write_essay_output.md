When you think about art and math, you might picture two completely different worlds. But what if they’re not so separate after all? This is the idea that the Math Art Stream aims to explore, and in our latest session, we dove into some fascinating intersections of these fields, including the whimsical yet profound insights of William Blake. 

Blake is often known for his intricate poetry and vivid imagery, but what does he have to do with math and art? At first glance, it may seem like a stretch. Yet, if we peel back the layers, we find a rich tapestry where Blake’s perspective can illuminate our understanding of both disciplines.

One of the key questions we grappled with is whether we can separate art from math. Is the beauty of a mathematical theorem comparable to the beauty of a painting? Or do they serve different purposes altogether? This tension between classification and creativity can be seen in how we approach the idea of active inference, a concept that ties into both cognitive science and the processes of creating art. It’s about understanding the world, not just observing it, and that’s where Blake’s vision can be particularly enlightening.

When we consider Blake’s view on the gothic style—dark, full of depth, and rich in emotion—we can draw parallels to how we engage with mathematical concepts. The gothic isn’t merely a style; it’s a lens through which we can interpret the struggles and triumphs of the human experience. And isn’t that what both math and art attempt to do? They seek to express and make sense of our reality, whether through numbers or brushstrokes.

As we ventured into discussions about Blake’s relationship with science, particularly his critique of Isaac Newton’s vision, it became clear that Blake was not against science itself, but rather the limitations of a singular perspective. He saw the world as multifaceted, filled with possibilities that transcend the rigid structures often imposed by purely rational thought. This insight resonates deeply in both art and math, where exploration and imagination are paramount.

Blake’s assertion that “without contraries, there is no progression” is a reminder that conflict and contrast can spark creativity. The act of blending ideas—like math and art—can lead to unexpected innovations. It prompts us to ask: What happens when we allow ourselves to think in ways that challenge established norms? Can we redefine what we consider to be art, or what constitutes mathematical beauty?

Moreover, as we discussed how Blake viewed the concept of knowledge, it became apparent that he valued direct experience over abstract reasoning. He believed that true understanding comes from engaging with the particulars of our surroundings. This perspective is especially relevant in our digital age, where we often interact with ideas in abstract forms. It challenges us to seek deeper connections with what we study, whether it’s through creating art or solving equations.

In our follow-up to the Math Art Stream, we’re not just reflecting on what was presented but also inviting dialogue. Everyone is welcome to share their thoughts, questions, or insights. This collaborative spirit is at the heart of both artistic endeavors and mathematical exploration. Just as Blake’s work invites us to question and reflect, so too does our ongoing conversation encourage a richer understanding of these intertwined fields.

As we continue to explore these ideas, let’s keep in mind the potential for growth that lies in the spaces between disciplines. Just like Blake’s art, which transcends the boundaries of his time, our exploration of math and art can lead to new interpretations and understandings of our world. Whether you’re an artist, a mathematician, or simply a curious mind, there’s always more to discover when we dare to connect the dots.
