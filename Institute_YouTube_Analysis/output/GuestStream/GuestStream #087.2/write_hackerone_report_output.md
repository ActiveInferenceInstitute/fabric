**Title:** Conceptual Framework for Cognitive Group Decision-Making through Story Graphs in the COGAR System

## Summary:
The COGAR system aims to facilitate collective cognition by allowing large groups to externalize their belief models through rich narrative structures known as story graphs. These graphs serve as a dynamic representation of user beliefs and can be used for effective deliberation and decision-making processes.

## Description:
The COGAR project is designed to create an open-source ecosystem that enhances group cognition, particularly in contexts requiring deliberation and problem-solving. At its core, COGAR utilizes story graphsâ€”meaning representations that convey the complex beliefs and narratives of users. Unlike traditional systems that limit input to multiple-choice formats or short text, COGAR allows users to contribute nuanced stories, which are then processed by a backend computational system.

The backend system assesses the quality of these stories, facilitates understanding among group members, and aids in digesting the multitude of narratives shared. Importantly, the system is not tasked with predicting the future or evaluating the accuracy of beliefs but rather focuses on organizing and clarifying the shared knowledge of the group.

By employing active inference as a lens for understanding cognition, the COGAR system aims to identify functional versus dysfunctional cognition within groups. The proposed meaning representation must accommodate various linguistic phenomena, support metadata integration, and allow for iterative updates to reflect evolving beliefs.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Gather a diverse group of individuals interested in a shared topic or decision-making process.
2. Introduce the concept of story graphs and explain how users can contribute their narratives about the topic.
3. Utilize the backend computational system to facilitate the collection and processing of the stories, allowing users to engage with each other's narratives.
4. Monitor the interactions, assess the quality of the contributed stories, and facilitate discussions based on the insights gained from the story graphs.
5. Iterate on the stories over multiple sessions, allowing users to refine their contributions based on feedback and emerging themes.

## Impact:
The COGAR system has the potential to transform group decision-making by leveraging the collective intelligence of large groups. By enabling participants to express their beliefs in rich, dynamic formats, COGAR can enhance understanding, foster collaboration, and ultimately lead to more informed and effective decisions in various contexts, from community governance to corporate strategy. This capability is crucial in addressing complex societal challenges where traditional decision-making frameworks may fall short.
