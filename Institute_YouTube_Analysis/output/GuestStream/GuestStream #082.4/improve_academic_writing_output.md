**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome, everyone. This is the Active Inference guest stream number 82.4, recorded on July 29, 2024. We are continuing our series of presentations and discussions with Robert Warden and colleagues. Today, we will explore the assessment of the brain wave hypothesis. I would like to extend my gratitude to Robert and all participants for joining us for this presentation.

The focus of this talk is on a hypothesis previously discussed in our live streams, which posits that there exists a wave-like phenomenon in the brain. The objective of this presentation is to evaluate the likelihood of this hypothesis being true. For those interested in earlier discussions, one of which addressed the connection between this wave and consciousness, please refer to the provided link to the Active Inference webpage.

In this presentation, I will first describe the wave hypothesis, followed by presenting evidence supporting and opposing it. Subsequently, I will address the question of how we can integrate these varied lines of evidence to estimate the overall probability of the wave's existence in the brain. Ultimately, I will present a Bayesian assessment, concluding that the probability of the existence of such a wave is approximately 0.5. While the specific numerical value is not critical, it is significant that this is not a negligible probability. Therefore, we cannot dismiss the wave hypothesis without careful consideration of its implications for brain function, should such a wave indeed exist.

The wave hypothesis suggests that there is a roughly spherical region in the brain where waves propagate in three dimensions. These waves represent objects in space, with a long-wavelength wave (denoted as λ2 in green) symbolizing an object at a short distance (R2), and a shorter-wavelength wave (in red) indicating an object at a greater distance. Essentially, the hypothesis proposes that neurons function as both transmitters and receivers of these waves, allowing the wave to serve as a form of working memory for a three-dimensional model of the surrounding environment.

An important aspect of this wave-based spatial memory is its performance. Basic calculations indicate that the number of waves in this spherical region is proportional to the diameter (D) divided by the minimum wavelength (λ_min). This suggests a substantial capacity for representation within the wave, with spatial precision on the order of λ_min over D, which can be notably small. The advantages of this wave storage system include high spatial precision, high capacity for representing diverse objects, low spatial distortion, and a straightforward physical representation of three-dimensional space akin to a hologram.

Next, I will address the evidence supporting the existence of such a wave in the brain, which can be categorized into three primary lines of evidence. The first comes from the mammalian thalamus, which is illustrated on the left in green. The thalamus is approximately spherical in shape, making it conducive to housing a wave. It possesses the necessary connections to integrate sensory data and relay this information to various cortical regions. 

The second line of evidence is derived from the central body of the insect brain. This structure, which is a small, centrally located part of the insect brain, has a remarkably conserved shape across all insect species, suggesting it is also well-suited for hosting a wave and has the requisite neural connections for spatial representation.

The third line of evidence stems from neural computational modeling. Three-dimensional spatial cognition is fundamental for an animal to navigate its environment effectively. I have previously attempted to construct models of spatial cognition at the level of David Marr's second level. The challenge lies in achieving the necessary precision in modeling spatial representation, as sensory data is typically precise. However, neurons, firing over approximately one-fifth of a second, produce only about ten spikes, leading to substantial imprecision in representing spatial dimensions.

Historically, neural models have treated neurons as highly precise units with real-valued outputs. However, real neurons exhibit spike trains that do not consistently represent numbers accurately over short timeframes. This gap in precision, which I believe has been overlooked, suggests that wave storage might fulfill this requirement. Therefore, the three main pieces of evidence for the wave hypothesis are: the mammalian thalamus, the insect central body, and the inadequacies of current neural computational models.

In conclusion, I will address how to assess the overall probability of the wave's existence. The wave hypothesis is a binary proposition: either such a wave exists or it does not. We seek to estimate the probability of its existence based on multiple lines of evidence, akin to estimating the likelihood of a biased coin landing heads up. By conducting numerous experiments, including varied methods of tossing the coin, we can derive a weighted average of the results.

As I have summarized, the evidence against the wave hypothesis includes prior considerations, such as the principle of parsimony, which suggests we should not introduce unnecessary hypotheses. Additional arguments suggest that classical neural models have sufficed, and the absence of direct observation of such a wave implies it may not exist. However, I contend that these arguments are weak, and the evidence in favor of the wave hypothesis, particularly regarding the thalamus and insect central body, remains compelling.

Ultimately, our Bayesian assessment has yielded a probability of approximately 0.5 for the existence of a wave in the brain. Although this figure is not definitive, it indicates that robust negative evidence would be necessary to invalidate the hypothesis. Consequently, we must consider the profound implications of a potential wave for our understanding of brain function.

Moving forward, I invite your insights and commentary on this hypothesis. Your feedback is invaluable as we continue to explore the complexities of brain function and cognition.
