- How do we combine those lines of evidence to make some overall estimate of how likely it is that there is a wave in the brain?
- What evidence is there that there is such a wave in the brain?
- What is the prior considerations that go against the wave hypothesis?
- What are the positive lines of evidence for the wave?
- How do you assess the overall probability that the wave is there?
- What are the smoking gun evidence in the thalamus?
- How does this wave work?
- How do we model a wave?
- How do we test this wave hypothesis?
- How would you unpack the spatial Precision in relation to the temporal Precision?
- How does the wave persist?
- How do neurons couple to it?
- Can there be a brain without any neurons?
- Could this theory be used to test whether or not someone in the ICU with brain damage is conscious?
- What are your next moves?
