- Probability of a wave in the brain is about 0.5.
- Need to seriously consider implications if a wave exists.
- Three main pieces of evidence support the wave hypothesis.
- Future tests of the wave hypothesis are necessary.
- Wave hypothesis may change understanding of brain function.
- Consciousness may be tied to wave dynamics in the brain.
