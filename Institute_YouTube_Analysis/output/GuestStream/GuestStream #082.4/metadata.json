  "description": "\"Assessment of the Brain Wave Hypothesis\"\nRobert Worden\n\nIt has been proposed that there is a wave excitation in animal brains, whose role is to represent three-dimensional local space in a working memory. If there is such a wave, it has far-reaching implications for neuroscience. It is important to assess whether or not the wave hypothesis is correct. In this talk, I  estimate the Bayesian probability that the wave exists, in the light of the evidence. The estimated probability of the wave is greater than 0.4, so the hypothesis cannot be easily dismissed. I describe possible further tests for it. I request commentary from other researchers, about the wave hypothesis and the analysis.\nhttps://wave-hypothesis.activeinference.institute/\n\nwith David Rudrauf, Kenneth Williford, Karl Friston, Alexander Ororbia\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
