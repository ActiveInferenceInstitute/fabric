Active inference is about understanding learning as an active, predictive process. It emphasizes that cognition isn't passive; rather, it involves making predictions about the world and adjusting those predictions based on new information. This idea is particularly relevant in educational settings, where curiosity and exploration should reign.

In school, we often see a disconnect. Children, filled with natural curiosity, find themselves trapped in rigid, teacher-centered environments that prioritize rote memorization over genuine understanding. A British principal once noted that children would rather be home sick than attend schoolâ€”a telling indictment of the current system.

To truly foster active learning, we need classrooms that embrace exploration and allow students to engage with their environment. This means creating spaces that encourage interaction, experimentation, and collaboration. In Montessori schools, for example, children are free to choose what they study and how they learn, which aligns perfectly with the principles of active inference.

Moreover, the rise of large language models presents both challenges and opportunities. They can provide information, but without careful integration into educational practices, they risk reinforcing outdated methods of knowledge delivery. Instead of seeing these tools as replacements for teachers, we should view them as resources that can enhance active learning.

Ultimately, reimagining education means shifting the focus from simply delivering information to nurturing a child's ability to engage with the world, predict outcomes, and learn from their experiences. That's the real game changer.
