    - Answer 1:

    - Question 2: In what ways can active inference inform the design of educational environments to enhance learning outcomes?
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: Discuss how the concept of prediction error within active inference could reshape our understanding of student engagement and motivation.
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Analyze the implications of active inference for educational practices, particularly in light of technological advancements such as large language models (LLMs).
    - Question 1: What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of integrating large language models into educational settings from the perspective of active inference?
    - Answer 1:

    - Question 2: How might the disembodied nature of LLMs pose challenges to the active inference model in educational contexts?
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: Evaluate the role of feedback mechanisms in the context of LLMs and active inference, particularly concerning student learning experiences.
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Explore the relationship between active inference and alternative educational methodologies, such as the Montessori method.
    - Question 1: Compare and contrast the Montessori approach to education with the principles of active inference in terms of student agency and exploration.
