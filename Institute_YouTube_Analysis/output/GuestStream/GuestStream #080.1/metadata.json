  "description": "\"Active Inference Goes to School. The Importance of Active Learning in the Age of Large Language Models\"\nLaura Desir\u00e9e Di Paolo, Ben White, Avel GU\u00c9NIN--CARLUT, Axel Constant, and Andy Clark\nhttps://osf.io/preprints/osf/zwa83\n\nHuman learning essentially involves embodied interactions with the material world. But our worlds now include increasing numbers of powerful and (apparently) disembodied generative AIs. In what follows we ask how best to understand these new (somewhat \u201calien\u201d, because of their disembodied nature) resources and how to incorporate them in our educational practices. We focus on methodologies that encourage exploration and embodied interactions with \u2018prepared\u2019 material environments, such as the carefully organised settings of Montessori education. Using the Active Inference Framework, we approach our questions by thinking about human learning as epistemic foraging and prediction error minimization. We end by arguing that generative AIs should figure naturally as new elements in prepared learning environments by facilitating sequences of precise prediction error enabling trajectories of self-correction. In these ways we anticipate new synergies between (apparently) disembodied and (essentially) embodied forms of intelligence.\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
