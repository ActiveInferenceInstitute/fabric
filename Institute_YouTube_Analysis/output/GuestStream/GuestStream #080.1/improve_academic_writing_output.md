**Refined and Improved Text:**

Greetings. Today is April 22, 2024. We are currently engaged in the Active Inference Guest Stream 80.1 with Laura Desiderio discussing "Active Inference Goes to School: The Importance of Active Learning in the Age of Large Language Models." The format will consist of a presentation followed by a discussion. Thank you, Laura, for joining us; I look forward to this session.

Thank you for having invited me. I will present one of our latest publications, titled "Active Inference Goes to School." This presentation serves as an overview of my talk, which I will attempt to deliver efficiently at the beginning so that we can allocate more time to the latter slides. I apologize in advance for any spelling errors or mistakes you may encounter in the images, as I had extensive discussions with Jud regarding the generation of images that would effectively illustrate my presentation. After numerous attempts, I ultimately selected the best available images.

Before we proceed, allow me to share a few personal details. My interest in learning began when I started university, largely because I was perceived as a slow learner in high school and not a high achiever. Consequently, I devoted my studies to exploring various forms of learning across species, the evolution of learning, and its implications for educational settings. I believed that educational environments present an ideal opportunity for success, as they comprise inherently curious beings—particularly children—who exhibit remarkable curiosity prior to formal schooling. Theoretically, schools should provide abundant learning opportunities, supported by trained educators who can answer children's inquiries. Regrettably, the reality in educational settings is often less than ideal. To quote a British principal during an interview, "It is remarkable that children would rather be home sick than attend school, the very place where they can learn." I find learning to be an enjoyable endeavor, and I believe it is my responsibility to reintroduce the joy of learning, especially in compulsory educational environments.

This slide presents some foundational literature on active inference and learning. While I will not delve too deeply into the specifics of active inference, I can refer questions to someone more knowledgeable on the topic. To illustrate the fundamental model of active inference, it is crucial to understand that cognition, in this framework, involves proactive engagement rather than passive reception of information. The agent actively makes predictions about the world and compares these predictions with actual experiences. When discrepancies arise—whether in terms of unexpected events or errors—the agent has two options: either update its predictive model to enhance future predictions or alter its actions in response to the environmental feedback.

In this cognitive model, learning becomes imperative. Discrepancies between predictions and the actual state of the world signal opportunities for learning and adaptation. Notably, predictions encompass not only thoughts and beliefs but also sensory and motor activities, which shape our understanding of the surrounding world. The active inference model efficiently explains various learning mechanisms, including individual trial and error, imitation, and the development of expertise through exploratory behavior.

Attention plays a critical role in educational settings, especially in relation to prediction error dynamics and the acquisition of competencies. Most importantly, the active inference process allows for the integration of development and learning—two often considered separate processes—by recognizing that predictions based on sensory and motor interactions also impact our biological and neurobiological structures.

As we developed our paper, we encountered three primary challenges: first, how to apply a cognitive theory such as active inference to real educational practices; second, how educational practices should be designed to align with our cognitive theory; and third, the role and influence of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), in education and other fields. The introduction of LLMs presents a significant challenge, as they operate in a disembodied manner. Users interact with these models through screens and keyboards, engaging only with input-output sequences while the underlying processes remain invisible.

Recent studies reveal that children, even at a young age, tend to trust the information provided by Google without understanding the source of that trust. This poses a parallel challenge to the use of LLMs in education. Therefore, it is essential to consider how we nurture human generative models in the age of artificial intelligence. I have explored various representations of how to integrate AI into educational settings, and a common theme is the tendency to anthropomorphize artificial intelligence. This raises the question of how we can create educational environments that enable our generative models to effectively interact with these powerful technologies.

One approach is what I refer to as the "traditional way," exemplified by the common image of a classroom filled with children aged eight to ten. This image reflects a teacher-centered educational approach, where human knowledge is organized into a curriculum that influences the child’s learning experience. Unfortunately, this model parallels the training of disembodied entities like LLMs, where fine-tuning occurs at various levels—affecting not just the children, but also the teachers, who often fine-tune entire classrooms rather than individual students.

While the active inference model is applicable in traditional settings, it does not fully align with the nuanced learning processes of children, particularly those under the age of twelve. Research indicates that young children often learn more from irrelevant contextual information than from the intended lesson, as they are still in the early stages of forming predictive models based on limited experiences.

Another issue is the dynamics of error learning in traditional educational settings. When feedback is delayed or derived from grades and external evaluations, it fails to provide an accurate error signal for the child’s generative model, leading to confusion between self-worth and performance. Studies indicate that children educated in traditional settings may develop a tendency toward error avoidance rather than learning from mistakes.

To foster active inference agents, educational environments must offer exploratory opportunities and allow for multiple iterations on tasks. This approach should incorporate multimodal and multisensory learning experiences, as predictions are shaped by various stimuli in the environment. Furthermore, development and learning should not be treated as separate entities; educational settings should facilitate experiences that enable children to construct abstract knowledge through environmental interactions.

In our exploration of existing educational approaches, we found that the Montessori method aligns closely with our vision for effective learning environments. Montessori classrooms are characterized by open spaces, multi-age learning groups, and freedom for children to choose their activities. This method emphasizes indirect teaching and the prepared environment, where learning materials are designed to facilitate immediate feedback and error correction.

Montessori education has gained recognition worldwide, with over 15,000 schools in more than 140 countries. Despite its popularity, the theoretical foundations of the Montessori method, particularly in cognitive science, remain under-explored. This presents an opportunity for further research into the ecological sustainability of educational practices and their broader implications.

In summary, as we consider the role of LLMs and AI in education, it is crucial to develop pedagogical approaches that prioritize critical thinking and adaptability. By combining elements of the Montessori method with active inference, we can create educational environments that nurture curiosity and foster effective learning. Thank you for your attention.
