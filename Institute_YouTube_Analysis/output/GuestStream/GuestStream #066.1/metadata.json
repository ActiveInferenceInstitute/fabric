  "description": "Adrian Bejan:\n\"The Physics of Life: How to Predict Evolution\"\"\nhttps://mems.duke.edu/faculty/adrian-bejan\n\nThe Constructal Law explains how Nature designs the phenomenon of flow and its impacts on the evolution of animate and inanimate, human and non-human systems alike. From the birth and evolution of civilization and technologies to our perceptions of time and beauty, configurations evolve.  They change because they are imbibed in freedom to change.    The challenge is to predict the flowing designs of nature, the lines of the drawing, the unknown 'boundary conditions', and 'constraints'. Adrian Bejan will show how the Constructal Law governs the natural design of movement distribution on the globe, city, and human body, showcasing its central role in the persistence (life) of all systems in nature.\n\nThis event is tailored for the general public, professionals, researchers, students, and anyone who is free to ask questions about our niche (nature) and how it impacts everything that lives, animals, rivers, designs, and ideas.\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
