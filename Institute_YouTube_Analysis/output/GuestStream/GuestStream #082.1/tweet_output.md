🌟 Excited to kick off Active Guest Stream 82.1 with Robert Warden today! 🎙️ We're diving deep into Bayesian model-based cognition and the Requirement Equation. 🧠✨

🔍 Join us as we explore how this equation relates to the Free Energy Principle & active inference, especially in 3D spatial cognition! 🌌

🧩 Key ideas:
- What brains **need** to do, not just how they do it.
- How animals can compute the Requirement Equation through brute force.
- The importance of internal models for complex decision-making. 🧭

💡 Let's uncover how these concepts fit into understanding consciousness and cognition! 💭
