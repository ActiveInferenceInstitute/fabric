# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Robert Warden presents the requirement equation, a mathematical model for understanding brain functions in relation to fitness and cognition.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. The requirement equation describes what brains need to compute for optimal fitness.
2. Unlike active inference, it does not specify how brains compute but focuses on outputs.
3. The equation is computationally expensive, making it impractical for animal brains.
4. Brains evolve to approximate the requirement equation for enhanced fitness.
5. The equation can be used to calibrate cognitive models like active inference.
6. It characterizes brain functions through a black box and gray box model framework.
7. In simple scenarios, brains may not need complex internal models to function optimally.
8. The equation integrates concepts from Bayesian theory and Markov decision processes.
9. Learning in animals can be analyzed through the lens of the requirement equation.
10. Future discussions will explore 3D spatial cognition and its implications for brain modeling.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. The requirement equation serves as a benchmark for brain fitness and cognitive modeling.
2. Understanding brain functions requires analysis of both external biology and internal mechanisms.
3. Active inference models can be improved by comparing their outputs to the requirement equation.
4. The complexity of tasks influences whether internal models are necessary for optimal decisions.
5. Collaborative and independent evolutionary pressures can shape brain functions in diverse ways.
