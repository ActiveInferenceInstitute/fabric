# SUMMARY
Robert Warden discusses the requirement equation in relation to Bayesian model-based cognition and its implications for understanding brain function and cognition.

# IDEAS:
- The requirement equation outlines what brains must do without defining how they achieve it.
- This equation serves as a mathematical yardstick for calibrating cognitive models, especially active inference.
- Animals do not compute the requirement equation but can produce results similar to it.
- The equation can analyze brain function based on external biological factors, not internal mechanisms.
- The analysis focuses on lifetime fitness across various encounters rather than on individual actions.
- A gray box model describes the brain's function without assuming internal processes or computations.
- The requirement equation can identify the best possible decision function for maximizing fitness.
- Bayesian cognition is not merely a hypothesis but an implication of the requirement equation.
- Active inference models can be tested against the requirement equation to refine their predictions.
- Internal models are essential in complex decision-making but unnecessary in simpler scenarios.
- The requirement equation can help compare real animal behaviors with computational models.
- Different domains require different assumptions about decision-making and brain function.
- Internal models in brains evolve as adaptations to environmental complexities over generations.
- Natural selection shapes brain functions to optimize fitness based on environmental challenges.
- The requirement equation integrates probabilistic models to enhance understanding of cognition.
- Inactive brains can function effectively without internal representations in simpler environments.

# INSIGHTS:
- The requirement equation provides a foundational framework for understanding brain evolution and cognition.
- Brains evolve towards optimal fitness as dictated by the requirement equation, enhancing adaptability.
- Decision-making processes depend on the complexity of environments and available actions.
- The necessity for internal models arises mainly in complex scenarios requiring nuanced decision-making.
- Calibration between cognitive models and real-world behaviors is crucial for validating predictions.
- Bayesian approaches in cognition can be derived from analyzing what brains are required to do.
