**Title:** Requirement Equation: A Mathematical Framework for Understanding Brain Functionality and Fitness in Cognitive Models

## Summary:
The requirement equation provides a mathematical framework for understanding what brains must accomplish to maximize fitness without making assumptions about how they achieve this. This approach contrasts with existing theories such as the free energy principle and active inference, offering a yardstick for comparing cognitive models.

## Description:
The requirement equation posits that the brain's objective is to compute outcomes that maximize the fitness of the organism. Unlike traditional models, this equation does not concern itself with the underlying neural mechanisms but focuses on the necessary computations. The requirement equation is akin to Bayes' theorem but includes additional terms that account for fitness outcomes. 

This mathematical formulation emerges from a black box model of cognition, where the brain processes sensory inputs to make decisions about actions. It emphasizes that while animal brains do not compute this equation directly due to computational constraints, we can utilize computational methods to derive it, serving as a benchmark against which cognitive models can be tested and calibrated. 

By deriving the requirement equation, we can analyze how well cognitive models, including active inference frameworks, align with the optimal performance indicated by this equation. The potential disconnect between internal models and environmental pressures highlights the necessity for brains to develop internal representations, especially in complex decision-making scenarios.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of the requirement equation and its relationship to cognitive models.
2. Set up a computational framework to simulate scenarios based on the requirement equation, utilizing probabilistic models and decision functions.
3. Compare the outcomes of the requirement equation with those generated by active inference models or other cognitive frameworks to identify performance gaps and areas for improvement.

## Impact:
The requirement equation serves as a foundational tool for understanding brain functionality and the evolutionary pressures shaping cognitive processes. By establishing a clear mathematical standard, it allows researchers to assess the efficacy of various cognitive models, ultimately enhancing our understanding of cognition in both simple and complex biological systems. The implications extend to the fields of neurobiology, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary biology, fostering a deeper comprehension of how brains adapt to their environments.
