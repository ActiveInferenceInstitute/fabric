Dr. Bejan is the internationally acclaimed physicist who discovered the Constructal Law \n\nIn our first gueststeam, ActInf GuestStream 066.1 ~ Adrian Bejan, \"The Physics of Life: How to Predict Evolution\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF3zyjv2Drw   we learned how to apply the Constructal Law to predict design in nature. \n\nIn this second episode, Dr. Bejan will explain the Constructal Law through the lens of freedom.  You can expect a captivating livestream event that promises to expand your intellectual curiosity with a liberating understanding of the natural evolution freedom plays within flow configurations. \n\nJoin us to: \n\nDiscover how the laws of physics govern the evolution of freedom.\nGain a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of nature and human systems.\nLearn how societal structures and governance mechanisms evolve to optimize the distribution and accessibility of freedom within the constraints of the environment.\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
