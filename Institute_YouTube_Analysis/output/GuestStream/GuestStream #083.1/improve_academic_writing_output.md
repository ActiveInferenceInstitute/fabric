**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome, everyone. This is Active Inference Guest Stream 83.1, featuring Susan Hasty and our guest, Simon Wardley. Susan will begin with a few introductory remarks before we delve into Simon's extensive resources and insightful perspectives. Thank you both for joining us. Susan, the floor is yours.

Are you ready for me? Here we go! Thank you, Simon. I have been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to introduce you to the Active Inference community. Your work on Wardley mapping and your numerous accomplishments have garnered immense admiration. It is remarkable how your humility complements your strategic brilliance, which resonates deeply with cultural norms. 

Now, I would like you to share your journey, particularly how you transitioned from being an expert on stage to recognizing the need for Wardley mapping. What inspired this shift?

Well, it was a seemingly ordinary day in the UK when I found myself contemplating various problems. To be honest, my initial thoughts were driven by a sense of randomness and a lack of clear direction. At the time, I was running a company, and I can illustrate this with a few slides that detail the formal history of my experiences.

Daniel, is it possible for me to share my slides? Thank you. I will not go through the entire 127-slide deck, but I would like to discuss a few key points, starting with the origins of mapping. I will explain what a map is and what it is not, and briefly touch on patterns, change gameplay, and value identification.

Let us begin with the origin of my mapping journey. I worked for a company called Fango, which was quite successful and profitable but faced a significant challenge: the CEO had no clear understanding of the business strategy. They were essentially improvising. I know this firsthand because I was the CEO at the time. I often crafted grand statements about our future direction, such as, "Our strategy is customer-focused, and we will lead an innovative effort in the market through agile techniques and open source." In reality, I merely rephrased statements from other companies.

I had no clear vision, so I began recording the language used by other CEOs regarding strategy and aggregated these phrases into what I termed "business-level abstractions of a healthy strategy," or "BLAS" for short. I compiled lists of commonly used buzzwords, such as "digital," "disruptive," "innovative," and "collaborative." I then created templates to auto-generate strategies, leading to nonsensical results. For instance, one generated statement read, "Our strategy is customer-focused; we will lead a disruptive effort in the market through innovative platforms and data to build a collaborative ecosystem." 

I would share these absurd statements with colleagues, and the responses I received were revealing: "This is the exact wording from our business plan," "I've seen two of these used already," and my favorite, "Aren't you just generating nonsense?" 

Recognizing my lack of understanding, I sought knowledge through reading. A pivotal moment occurred when a bookseller in Charing Cross, London, recommended I read "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu. It was in the second version that I encountered five factors crucial to competition. Competition involves groups seeking knowledge or resources, resulting in various forms such as conflict, cooperation, and collaboration.

As I explored these concepts further, I became fascinated by the idea of observing landscapes and understanding their dynamics. This led me to delve into military history and analyze historical battles, such as the Battle of Thermopylae, where a small contingent of Greek soldiers successfully defended against a much larger Persian force. I began to consider how maps could serve as tools for communication and decision-making within my own business.

I initially utilized SWOT diagrams to analyze strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, but eventually realized that I needed a more nuanced understanding of the landscape in which my business operated. I sought out maps that could provide this insight but found that most available resources were merely graphs, lacking the depth and meaning of true maps.

Through my exploration, I identified three essential components for creating a meaningful map: an anchor (such as magnetic north), positional indicators for each component, and consistency of movement. I began mapping my business, focusing on user needs and recognizing the intricate relationships between various elements of the operation.

This process revealed that I was not merely depicting a static landscape but rather capturing the dynamic evolution of components within the system. My first map, created in 2005, exposed my assumptions about running a tea shop, allowing others to challenge and question my approach.

Throughout my career, I have employed mapping techniques to facilitate discussions on complex topics, ranging from Brexit to healthcare. By utilizing maps, we can foster constructive dialogue and challenge prevailing narratives without putting individuals on the defensive.

In summary, mapping has become an invaluable tool for understanding landscapes, identifying opportunities, and encouraging collaborative problem-solving. I have applied these principles across various domains, including government projects that resulted in significant cost savings. By continuously refining my approach and embracing the dynamic nature of mapping, I have been able to contribute meaningfully to strategic discussions in diverse contexts.

I appreciate the opportunity to share my insights with you today and look forward to exploring how these concepts can further inform our understanding of active inference.
