Mapping is an interesting concept, especially in the context of understanding complex systems. At its core, mapping is about representation. When we create a map, we’re trying to capture the essence of a landscape, whether that landscape is geographical, organizational, or even cognitive. The challenge lies in the fact that all maps are simplifications. They highlight certain features while obscuring others.

Take, for example, the distinction between graphs and maps. A graph merely shows connections between nodes without any inherent meaning to the space itself. In contrast, a map adds context—position and movement—that gives depth to our understanding. This is crucial when we think about how we navigate through challenges in business or strategy. 

In my experience, many organizations struggle with understanding their landscapes. They often operate based on assumptions and past experiences, leading to decisions that lack grounding in the current environment. A map can expose these assumptions, facilitating discussions that challenge the status quo.

Moreover, the process of creating a map—engaging diverse perspectives, aggregating insights—can serve as a powerful tool for collective intelligence. It allows teams to visualize their environment and make informed decisions. Ultimately, mapping is not just about creating a static representation; it’s about fostering a dynamic conversation that evolves with our understanding of the world. This is where the real value lies.
