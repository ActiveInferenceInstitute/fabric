**Title:** Biological Neurons Outperform Deep Reinforcement Learning in Sample Efficiency in Simulated Gaming Environments

## Summary:
This report discusses a study in which biological neuronal cultures were embedded in a simulated game environment to compare their performance with traditional deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The findings indicate that biological neurons demonstrate superior sample efficiency, achieving better learning outcomes with significantly fewer training episodes than conventional RL methods.

## Description:
The study conducted by Cortical Labs and Monash University involved human and mouse cortical neuronal cultures interacting with a closed-loop system in a Pong game environment. The primary aim was to assess the performance and learning capabilities of these neuronal cultures against deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, A2C, and PPO).

The biological neurons were able to learn and improve their gameplay through feedback mechanisms, where the sensory region received information about the ball's position, and the motor regions acted accordingly. The neurons demonstrated improved performance metrics, such as average rally lengths and reduced missed balls (Aces), indicating effective learning and adaptation to the game.

In contrast, the deep RL algorithms, while capable of learning, exhibited lower sample efficiency, requiring more training episodes to achieve similar or lesser performance compared to the neuronal cultures. This disparity suggests fundamental differences in learning mechanisms between biological systems and traditional artificial intelligence models.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Set up the biological neuronal cultures on a high-density multi-electrode array (MEA) and allow them to acclimatize.
2. Integrate the neuronal cultures into the closed-loop Pong game environment, ensuring the sensory and motor regions are predefined.
3. Implement feedback mechanisms where sensory input is provided based on the ball's X and Y coordinates, and motor output is recorded to assess performance over gameplay.
4. Compare the performance of the neuronal cultures against the results obtained from training traditional deep RL algorithms (DQN, A2C, and PPO) using the same gameplay environment and training episode constraints.

## Impact:
This research highlights the potential of biological neuronal cultures as computational units that could surpass traditional AI methods in specific tasks, particularly in terms of sample efficiency and adaptability. The findings may pave the way for future applications in drug discovery, cognitive modeling, and the development of biologically inspired computing systems, emphasizing the importance of understanding biological learning mechanisms for advancements in artificial intelligence.
