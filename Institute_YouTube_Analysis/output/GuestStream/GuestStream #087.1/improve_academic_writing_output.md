**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome to the Active Inference Guest Stream 87.1, held on September 5th, 2024. Today, we are joined by John Boy and Lee ER. Lee, please introduce yourself and provide some contextual thoughts, including an introduction of John as you see fit. Following your introduction, we will engage in a presentation and discussion with John. Thank you, Lee.

Thank you, Daniel. I encountered John through the Active Inference Institute, where he was the only other individual exploring the intersection of societal transformation and active inference. I was excited to connect with him and attended his inaugural live stream discussing his science-driven transformation papers. Subsequently, I reached out, and we discovered a shared interest in functional forms of cognition at scale and the potential for a software solution to facilitate this. Our discussions over the months have culminated in John producing this paper, which I am eager to delve into during today's presentation. 

Thank you, Lee. I appreciate your insights. Our discussions over the past months have indeed been instrumental in the development of this paper. I am John Boy, a research fellow at the Active Inference Institute, and I am honored to hold this position. Today, we will discuss two preprints that are publicly available, both focused on group cognition at scale. I am proposing an online software ecosystem designed for group cognition at scale, and during this session, I will provide an overview of the project. Our second guest stream will take place on September 10th, where we will explore more technical details related to meaning representation.

This first paper can be accessed on arXiv, and I encourage everyone to download it. 

Next slide, please. I am introducing a concept called the COGAR ecosystem, which stands for Cognitive Narrative. It is important to note that this project is still in its incubation phase, and the two papers represent the work done thus far. I hope to engage others in the research community, as well as in civil society, to collaborate on this project moving forward.

In essence, COGAR is an open-source, extensible online ecosystem comprising software, resources, tools, applications, and services that facilitate group cognition, particularly for large groups. This ecosystem aims to enhance deliberation, strategizing, problem-solving, and decision-making. Throughout the presentation, we will explore various use cases for COGAR, although these are the primary applications I had in mind during the project's development.

COGAR assists users in articulating their beliefs and conveying their understanding of the world in relation to specific situations to their group. A group can be defined in many ways, such as a city, corporation, or school, all striving to process the understandings and beliefs of their members toward a common goal, be it problem-solving or another objective. By "telling their story," users can express their beliefs about the nature of a situation and its implications.

I differentiate between the terms "story" and "narrative," as I am not referring to a conventional written narrative but rather to a representation of beliefs that encapsulates the who, what, where, how, and why of a situation. 

Next slide, please. 

While there are existing services and applications for group collaboration, such as voting apps, I propose that the COGAR ecosystem represents a more sophisticated approach. It enables users to create potentially rich stories, which can vary in length and complexity, allowing for conditional narratives. The challenge lies in how such rich information can be processed by large groups. The proposed solution includes a backend computational system that assists users in constructing stories, aids the group in digesting and analyzing these narratives, and identifies areas of consensus and divergence.

This system also evaluates the quality of stories to ensure relevance to the group's objectives and provides feedback to users when clarifications are necessary. In this way, the system functions as an engaged active listener, akin to a friend who seeks to understand the nuances of the user's story.

Next slide, please. 

I have been discussing a group that is interested in a particular topic or problem. It is vital to clarify what I mean by "group." A group is a collection of individuals who exhibit coordinated behavior in response to dynamic conditions over time. Examples include social clubs, civic organizations, corporations, and political entities such as cities and nations. Groups can vary widely in terms of formality, size, and structure, and they engage in various cognitive processes to fulfill their purposes.

In essence, a group can be conceptualized as an organism that performs cognition. Just as an organism must sense its environment, process information, anticipate outcomes, evaluate options, and take action, so too must a group engage in these cognitive processes to thrive.

Next slide, please. 

Having provided an overview of COGAR, it is pertinent to consider its significance. COGAR is fundamentally about enhancing group cognition. There may be a perceived need for improved cognitive processes, particularly within political or corporate groups. Individuals may possess important narratives that could aid in addressing societal issues or in making more informed decisions. 

Moreover, COGAR is not merely a platform for sharing stories; it is designed to ensure that contributions are genuinely heard and understood. For instance, the ability to effectively communicate complex issues, such as climate change or poverty, requires a system that facilitates meaningful dialogue and decision-making. 

The potential impact of COGAR extends across various fields of science. For example, in medicine, doctors must collaborate to make decisions about patient care, and patients can articulate their narratives in a standardized format that enhances understanding and analysis.

Next slide, please. 

When discussing large groups, it is essential to clarify what constitutes a "large group." This may include dozens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions of participants. While face-to-face communication may suffice for smaller groups, it becomes impractical for larger gatherings. COGAR is particularly targeted at facilitating cognitive processes in large group settings, although it can also benefit individuals who wish to document their stories.

The question at hand is how an online ecosystem can support the sharing of complex narratives among large groups. The COGAR project proposes a backend computational system that supports this endeavor, enabling users to share their stories and beliefs while allowing the group to collectively develop a shared understanding.

Next slide, please. 

We have discussed what constitutes a group and the concept of cognition, which is a central theme in cognitive science. I draw heavily on the active inference framework to define cognition, which serves as a normative principle underlying cognitive processes in both biological and artificial agents. Active inference posits that an intelligent agent possesses an internal generative model that guides its actions and perceptions in the world.

This model allows the agent to predict potential outcomes based on its actions and to learn from its experiences. The purpose of cognition, from an active inference perspective, is to reduce uncertainty and maintain conditions that are favorable for the agent's well-being.

Next slide, please. 

Given this framework, COGAR can be viewed as a cognitive architecture that facilitates group cognition. Cognition requires an architecture that integrates information and coordinates actions, and for a group, this includes the cognitive structures of its individual members as well as the norms, rules, and processes that guide decision-making.

Next slide, please. 

As we delve deeper into the COGAR project, we will explore the specific design of the story graph, its function as a meaning representation, and how it can be applied across various contexts. The ultimate goal is to facilitate functional cognition within groups and enhance decision-making processes. 

Next slide, please. 

I look forward to our next session, where we will discuss meaning representations in greater detail. In the meantime, I encourage participants to review the papers and reach out with any questions or comments. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to continuing our discussion on September 10th.
