Some groups are large, and that setting presents unique challenges. The small-group setting often involves face-to-face dialogue, but group cognition in the large-group setting typically requires some form of online interaction. New approaches are needed to facilitate the kind of rich communication and information processing that are required for effective, functional cognition in the online setting, especially for groups characterized by thousands to millions of participants who wish to share potentially complex, nuanced, and dynamic perspectives. This concept paper proposes the CogNarr (Cognitive Narrative) ecosystem, which is designed to facilitate functional cognition in the large-group setting. The paper's contribution is a novel vision as to how recent developments in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and related fields might be scaled and applied to large-group cognition, using an approach that itself promotes further scientific advancement. A key perspective is to view a group as an organism that uses some form of cognitive architecture to sense the world, process information, remember, learn, predict, make decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. The CogNarr ecosystem is designed to serve as a component within that architecture.\n\nGuestStream #087.2 https://youtube.com/live/52eHP5ReG34 \n\nSlides for GuestStream #087 series can be found at: https://coda.io/d/AII_do5M5iYau8H/Cognitive-Narrative-Ecosystems-CogNarr_su9TZb_u#_luGiGZba\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
