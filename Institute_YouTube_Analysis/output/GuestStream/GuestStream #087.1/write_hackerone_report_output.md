**Title:** Conceptual Framework for Group Cognition in the COGAR Ecosystem

## Summary:
The COGAR ecosystem proposes an open-source online framework aimed at facilitating group cognition at scale. This framework allows users to externalize their belief models and narratives, enabling large groups to process complex information collaboratively, assess diverse perspectives, and enhance decision-making through structured cognitive processes.

## Description:
The COGAR ecosystem stands for "Cognitive Narrative and Group Action Representation." It serves as an online platform where users can articulate their beliefs regarding various situations or problems. By converting individual narratives into structured story graphs, COGAR aims to capture the complexity of human cognition and facilitate better understanding among group members.

The system is designed to assist users in creating rich, nuanced narratives that can be dynamically assessed and analyzed. This involves a back-end computational framework that performs various functions, including quality assessment of narratives, inference for queries, and analytics to highlight commonalities and differences in group beliefs. The goal is to enable a large number of participants to share their individual stories while maintaining coherence and clarity, thereby fostering a collective understanding of the issues at hand.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Access the COGAR platform (the link to the platform will be provided in future communications).
2. As a user, create an account and log in to the system.
3. Begin by inputting your belief model regarding a specific topic or issue, using either natural language text or voice input.
4. Observe how the system processes your input and generates a story graph, while also allowing you to view and edit your narrative as needed.
5. Participate in a group event where multiple users share their narratives. Analyze the generated analytics to understand how different stories intersect and diverge.
6. Engage in discussions with other users to refine your narratives based on collective insights.

## Impact:
The COGAR ecosystem has the potential to revolutionize group decision-making processes by enhancing cognitive collaboration among large groups. By capturing and analyzing complex belief models, it can lead to improved understanding of social issues, foster engagement in civic matters, and enable organizations to make more informed decisions. This framework not only aids in harmonizing diverse perspectives but also serves as a valuable repository for understanding group cognition in various contexts.
