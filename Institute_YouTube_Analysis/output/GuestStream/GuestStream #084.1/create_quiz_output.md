Subject: Habits and Adaptive Learning in Agential Systems
* Learning objective: Understand the nature of habits and their relation to adaptive learning and agential systems.
    - Question 1: How do you define a habit in the context of agential systems, and what are the implications of this definition for understanding human behavior?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Discuss the spectrum of reinforcement learning versus maladaptive learning. How do these concepts influence the development of habits in individuals?
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: Analyze the role of environmental stimuli in shaping habits and adaptive learning behaviors in biological organisms. Provide examples to support your analysis.
    - Answer 3:
* Learning objective: Explore interventionary approaches to enhance adaptive learning.
    - Question 1: What are the four primary paradigms of interventionary approaches mentioned in the presentation, and how do they contribute to enhancing adaptive learning?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Critically evaluate the potential effectiveness of technological interventions in promoting adaptive learning. What challenges might arise in their implementation?
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: How can understanding the relationship between nature and nurture inform the development of interventionary strategies for adaptive learning?
    - Answer 3:
* Learning objective: Investigate the interplay between cognitive load, metabolic load, and decision-making in relation to habits.
    - Question 1: Describe the relationship between cognitive load and metabolic load in the context of habit formation and adaptive learning. How do these loads impact decision-making processes?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: What is the significance of the 'pap cycle' (perception-action-priors) in understanding how agents make decisions in adaptive learning contexts?
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: Discuss how anxiety can affect the capacity for effective decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. What strategies can agents employ to mitigate this impact?
    - Answer 3:
* Learning objective: Assess the implications of language and communication on cooperation and collective behavior change among agents.
    - Question 1: How does the capacity for language and structured communication differentiate humans from other agents in terms of cooperative behavior and societal development?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Analyze the role of collective insight in driving behavior change within groups. What mechanisms facilitate this process?
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: Evaluate the potential for technology to enhance communication and cooperation among agents. What ethical considerations must be taken into account?
    - Answer 3:
