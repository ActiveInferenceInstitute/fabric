**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome. Today is May 30, 2024, and we are engaged in Act Imp Guest Stream 84.1. This session will feature a presentation and discussion with Jesse G. Thank you, Jesse, for joining us; we anticipate an insightful presentation. Following your presentation, we will monitor the live chat for further discussion.

Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my work. This presentation will primarily provide an overview of my debut publication, which is part of a series of papers focusing on habits and adaptive learning in relation to agential systems. My research aims to deepen our understanding of agential systems, primarily through the lens of biological organisms, and to connect these insights with human behavior.

The motivation for this series of publications arose from a literature review I conducted, which initially centered on drug dependency rather than addiction in a broader context. I reached out to a colleague over three years ago in 2021, which marks the beginning of this research journey. My initial connection was with a group of graduate students at a state university who were examining data on addiction, specifically related to drug dependency. I was disappointed with the approach taken in their paper and provided a critique, recognizing the need to better understand the roots of addictive behavior.

This inquiry led me to contemplate the nature of habits, which are often viewed negatively. I believe it is crucial to evaluate whether habits can be beneficial or detrimental and how we adapt to the challenges we encounter as human beings. More specifically, I have been exploring how we can reinforce our fitness by engaging more effectively with our environment and with one another throughout our lives.

The focus of my work has been on adaptive learning and the primary intervention strategies that can enhance our behavior. I will delve into these approaches later in the presentation. It is important to view habits as existing on a spectrum, with reinforcement at one end and maladaptive behavior at the other. This perspective allows us to consider how our habits can either support or hinder our fitness and interactions within our environment.

I am an independent researcher and have spent considerable time examining academic literature. For this series of publications, I have reviewed nearly a thousand papers, and while I have encountered a wealth of information, I must prioritize the most relevant content for my research.

In my work, I emphasize the importance of not only data but also the narratives that arise from that data. Many data science communities tend to overlook the storytelling aspect, which is essential for understanding the implications of our findings. My goal is to construct models that not only analyze data but also articulate coherent narratives that enhance our understanding of the phenomena we study, particularly concerning habits and adaptive learning.

As I present my work, I will outline the four primary paradigms of intervention approaches designed to leverage adaptive learning in human behavior. I will also introduce a foundational model I have developed.

To summarize, this paper serves as an overview of habits and adaptive learning in the context of agential systems. Habits can be defined as persistent patterns of behavior that influence our interactions with the environment and other agents. On one hand, agents can engage in constructive ways that optimize their fitness through reinforcement learning. Conversely, they can also engage in maladaptive learning, which detracts from their fitness.

The comprehensive nature of this paper stems from its connection to various literature exploring habits, agential systems, and perception-action dynamics. I will now begin with the abstract and build upon the key points outlined in the paper.

In conclusion, I would like to highlight my next steps, which will involve exploring intervention strategies aimed at adaptive learning. I intend to investigate how technology and various engagement methods can enhance individual and collective agency. If anyone is interested in collaborating or discussing these topics further, please feel free to reach out to me via my email.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to our discussion.
