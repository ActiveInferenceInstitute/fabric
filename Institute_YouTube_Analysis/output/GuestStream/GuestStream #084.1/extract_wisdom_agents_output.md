SUMMARY
- Jesse G discusses his research on habits, adaptive learning, and agential systems in human behavior.

IDEAS:
- Habits should be understood on a spectrum, balancing reinforcement and maladaptive behaviors.
- The root of addictive behavior may be linked to fundamental human habits.
- Adaptive learning can enhance human engagement with the environment and improve fitness.
- Cognitive load and metabolic load interact to influence decision-making and behavior.
- Individual agency is shaped by both nature and nurture, affecting habits and learning.
- Reinforcement learning optimizes behavior, while maladaptive learning detracts from fitness.
- Emotional processing is crucial in decision-making and aligns perceptions with actions.
- Cooperation among agents is vital for survival and fosters human civilization development.
- The perception-action-prior cycle influences how agents engage with their environment.
- Novelty exploration is key to handling uncertainty and enhancing adaptive learning.
- Language facilitates cooperation and the development of collective knowledge among agents.
- The environment presents both resources and obstacles, impacting agents' fitness.
- Cognitive strain can arise from prolonged exposure to stressors, affecting adaptive behavior.
- Understanding brain regions involved in habits can enhance insights into adaptive learning.
- Technology can be harnessed to improve agency and adaptive learning strategies.
- The integration of emotional and cognitive processes can optimize decision-making.
- Habits can be reinforced or maladaptive based on environmental constraints.
- The concept of homeostasis relates to how agents maintain fitness in changing environments.
- Generalizations of sensations are essential for interpreting stimuli and guiding actions.
- Risk-taking behavior can be adaptive or maladaptive depending on context and intention.
- The interplay of individual and collective behaviors shapes human interactions and society.

INSIGHTS:
- Habits influence adaptive learning and are essential for optimizing human agency.
- The balance between reinforcement and maladaptive behaviors is crucial for fitness.
- Emotional processing enhances decision-making and aligns with adaptive behaviors.
- Cooperation among agents fosters survival and societal development.
- Understanding the perception-action-prior cycle can improve engagement with the environment.
- Novelty exploration is vital for adapting to uncertainty and optimizing behavior.
- Language serves as a tool for enhancing cooperation and collective knowledge.
- Cognitive strain from stressors impacts the ability to adapt and learn.
- Insights into brain regions involved in habits can inform adaptive learning strategies.
- Technology should be designed to complement human behaviors rather than compromise them.

- "Cooperation is essential for how humans have developed modern civilization."
- "The perception-action-prior cycle is fundamental to how agents engage with stimuli."
- "Novelty exploration can help agents handle uncertainty in their environments."
- "Cognitive strain can lead to maladaptive behaviors affecting agents' fitness."
- "Language allows us to develop structured knowledge and enhance cooperation."
- "Understanding the brain's role in habits can inform our approach to adaptive learning."
- "Technology can be harnessed to better facilitate engagement and adaptive behaviors."
- "Emotional processing is key to aligning perceptions and actions effectively."

HABITS:
