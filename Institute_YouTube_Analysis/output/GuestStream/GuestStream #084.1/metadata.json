  "description": "The Nature of Habits and Agential Systems\nJesse G\n\nUnderstanding persisting behavioral compositions, also known as habits and what they have to do with agent-based modeling of systems. Investigating agent-based modeling dynamics generally from the point of view of better understanding human behavior and provide insight on more optimal means to improve how we as humans manage our cognition and bodily functioning while facilitating sufficient symbiotic co-existence among each other as well as our environment and other agents as general intelligent multi-agent systems. \n\n0:00:00 - 0:13:14 Introducing content and self-introduction\n0:13:14 - 0:17:44 Stepping through the paper... \n0:17:44 - 0:18:36 Perceptions... Actions... Priors... denoting the PAP-cycle and the critically existential nature of stimulus... \n0:18:36 - 0:21:43 Single Agent Systems vs Multi-Agent Systems... focusing on the contextualization of Multi-Agent Systems\n0:21:43 - 0:23:15 Classical Computer Systems vs Agential Systems... and the fundamental nature of stimulus being critical for agential systems...\n0:23:15 - 0:28:36 Elaborating on Perception in PAP-cycle \n0:28:36 - 0:31:23 The problem of the capacity of agents to resolve issues with perception... understanding veridical perception limits\n0:31:23 - 0:32:57 Elaborating more on the nature of habits and their critical role in regulating agency for agential systems... nature vs nurture dynamics... intrinsic vs extrinsic variability\n0:32:57 - 0:35:12 metabolic load vs cognitive load... thinking bottom-up as opposed to top-down dynamics regulating the integrity of agents\n0:35:12 - 0:37:57 Elaborating more on nature vs nurture dynamics\n0:37:57 - 0:39:20 Dynamics of metabolic load\n0:39:20 - 0:41:43 Routines being fundamental to the regulation of habits\n0:41:43 - 0:43:47 Regarding the nature of environment and agents being dynamical and never in a fixed static state...\n0:43:47 - 0:44:13 Intrinsic vs extrinsic variability in terms of regularity\n0:44:13 - 0:46:30 More elaboration on reinforcement learning as opposed to maladaptive learning... regarding tug-of-war transient dynamics\n0:46:30 - 0:51:09 Dynamics of goal-directed oriented behavior being connected to habits\n0:51:09 - 0:53:36 Dynamics in which agents wrestle to regulate their optimal integrity... or fitness... in the face of entropy\n0:53:48 - 0:56:31 Resources as opposed to obstacles within the embedded environment in which agents are existentially bound to\n0:56:31 - 1:01:08 Dynamics of homeostatic regulation being central to fitness with respect to guided random search optimization behavior...\n1:01:08 - 1:08:33 Elaborating on Actions and Priors as opposed to Perceptions \n1:08:33 - 1:13:10 Back to guided random search optimization... elaborating more on guided and search aspects as opposed to randomness\n1:13:10 - 1:16:58 Homeostatic Regulation being critical to agents regulating their integrity\n1:17:16 - 1:19:09 Summarizing homeostatic regulation\n1:19:09 - 1:30:05 Mechanistic interpretability explanation of the PAP-cycle...\n1:30:05 - 1:35:24 Hierarchical vs Heterarchical processing structure of the central nervous systems of humans as multi-agent systems... prioritization as opposed to selective tuning parameter mechanisms\n1:35:24 - 1:38:12 introspective and interoceptive as opposed to proprioceptive capacities regulating the PAP-cycle\n1:38:18 - 1:41:56 Small summary regarding regions of the brain responsible for coordinating PAP-cycle dynamics\n1:42:18 - 1:45:54 More elaboration on generalizations of sensations... elaborating more on metabolic load being a visceral process that is constantly happening as the agent continues to exist\n1:45:54 - 1:54:12 System 1 and System 2 coupled with The Rider and The Elephant... reasoning interwoven with emotions (affective processing)... understanding embodied cognition\n1:54:12 - 1:55:16 Re-summarizing hierarchical as opposed to heterarchical processing\n1:55:16 - 2:07:37 Emphasizing that reality is an interface... more regarding existential embedding of agents within the environment they are bound to exist in\n2:07:37 - 2:14:11 Preserving viability... regarding inter-agent cooperation dynamics\n2:14:11 - 2:33:39 Dynamics in which agents handle moments of uncertainty... interpretive vs functional-based indeterminism\n2:34:10 - 2:38:17 Elaborating on reinforcement learning regarding the role of deterrence\n2:38:17 - 2:42:00 Regarding reinforcement learning \n2:42:00 - 2:44:55 Elaborating on maladaptive learning\n2:44:55 - 2:46:30 Free Will dynamics...\n2:46:30 - 2:54:21 Concluding remarks\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
