# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Jesse G discusses habits and adaptive learning in agential systems, emphasizing the balance between reinforcement and maladaptive behaviors.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Overview of habits and adaptive learning concerning agential systems is presented.
2. Research began in 2021, focusing on drug dependency and addiction.
3. Habits are viewed on a spectrum of reinforcement versus maladaptive learning.
4. Importance of understanding biological organisms to inform human behavior.
5. Complex systems-based models are developed to understand habits and learning.
6. The "pap cycle" involves perception, action, and anticipation in agent behavior.
7. Cooperative engagement among agents enhances overall fitness and survival.
8. Cognitive strain from prolonged stressors impacts the capacity for adaptive learning.
9. Future research will explore interventionary approaches to enhance adaptive learning.
10. Jesse seeks collaboration to develop systems that complement human behavior.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Habits can be both reinforcing and maladaptive, affecting human behavior significantly.
2. Understanding the biological basis of agency can inform better learning strategies.
3. Cooperation among individuals is critical for optimizing fitness in complex environments.
4. Addressing cognitive strain can improve adaptive learning and decision-making.
5. Future research will focus on practical interventions to enhance adaptive behaviors.
