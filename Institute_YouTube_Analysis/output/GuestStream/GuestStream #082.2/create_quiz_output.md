Subject: Three-Dimensional Spatial Cognition in Bees and Bats

* Learning objective: Understanding the challenge classical neuroscience faces in modeling 3D spatial cognition.
    - Question 1: What are the main arguments presented by Robert Warden against the classical neuroscience perspective on spatial cognition?
    - Question 2: How does the concept of "active inference" relate to the acquisition of 3D spatial understanding in small animals?
    - Question 3: In what ways does the imprecision and slowness of neurons pose a challenge for representing 3D space according to Warden's findings?

* Learning objective: Explaining the mechanisms by which animals build 3D models from 2D sensory data.
    - Question 1: What is the process of "structure from motion" and how does it facilitate the construction of 3D spatial models in animals?
    - Question 2: How do different sensory modalities, such as vision and echolocation, contribute to an animal's spatial cognition?
    - Question 3: Describe the role of short-term spatial memory in the model developed by Warden for understanding 3D space.

* Learning objective: Evaluating the effectiveness of different computational models for simulating 3D spatial cognition.
    - Question 1: Compare and contrast the full Bayesian model with the dynamic object tracking model in terms of their computational efficiency and accuracy in representing spatial cognition.
    - Question 2: What implications does the addition of neural noise have on the performance of the tracking model used in the demonstration program?
    - Question 3: How does Warden's program simulate the differences in spatial cognition between bees and bats, and what insights does it provide into their respective navigation strategies?

* Learning objective: Discussing potential alternative models for 3D spatial cognition.
    - Question 1: What evidence does Warden present for the hypothesis of wave storage in the brain, and how does this challenge traditional neural models?
    - Question 2: In what ways might the structure of the insect central body support the hypothesis of wave-based spatial representation?
    - Question 3: How does the mammalian thalamus's anatomy lend credence to the idea of a wave storage mechanism for spatial cognition?

* Learning objective: Analyzing the implications of Warden's findings for future research in neuroscience.
    - Question 1: What are the potential benefits of pursuing a twin-track research program focusing on both neural models and hybrid wave-neural models for spatial cognition?
    - Question 2: How might a better understanding of spatial cognition in insects and mammals inform our approach to artificial intelligence and robotics?
    - Question 3: Discuss the significance of understanding the interplay between movement and sensory perception in enhancing our knowledge of animal navigation strategies.
