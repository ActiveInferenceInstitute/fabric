- Neurons cannot represent three-dimensional space due to imprecision and slowness.
- By October 2024, a neural computational model of 3D space should be built.
- Confidence level is uncertain; it depends on ongoing research developments.
- Verification will involve building a working model that demonstrates effective 3D spatial cognition.

- Animals build a 3D model of space through movement and sensory input.
- By June 2025, we should see experimental results supporting this model.
- Confidence level is moderate; based on existing animal behavior studies.
- Verification will involve empirical studies showing animals effectively use 3D models.

- The FP neural process model could advance understanding of 3D spatial cognition.
- By December 2024, initial findings from this model should be available.
- Confidence level is high given its theoretical grounding.
- Verification will involve published research findings.

- Evidence for a wave storing spatial data in the brain will be explored.
- By mid-2025, evidence should be compiled and analyzed.
- Confidence level is moderate; depends on ongoing research in neuroanatomy.
- Verification will involve anatomical studies correlating brain structure with wave storage theory.
