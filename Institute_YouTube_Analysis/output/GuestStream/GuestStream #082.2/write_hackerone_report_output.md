**Title:** Inadequate Neural Representation of 3D Spatial Cognition in Bees and Bats

## Summary:
The current understanding of how small animals like bees and bats represent three-dimensional (3D) space is challenged by the limitations of neural processing. This report highlights that traditional neural models may not adequately support the precision required for effective 3D spatial cognition due to inherent imprecision and speed limitations of neurons.

## Description:
The presentation explores the computational model of 3D spatial cognition in bees and bats, suggesting that neurons alone cannot accurately represent 3D space due to their slow and imprecise nature. The main hypothesis posits that animals construct a model of their environment through a process called "structure from motion" (SFM), which relies on movement to derive spatial information from 2D sensory data. 

The demonstration program showcases three distinct models of 3D spatial cognition:
1. A full Bayesian model that provides the most accurate representation based on sensory input.
2. A dynamic object tracking model that updates object estimates over time.
3. A noisy tracking model that incorporates memory noise, demonstrating how precision degrades under neural noise.

These models reveal that while animals can create a reasonably accurate 3D representation of their environment, the introduction of memory noise significantly hinders their ability to track objects accurately.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Download the demonstration program from the provided link.
2. Launch the program and select the bee or bat model.
3. Observe the 3D spatial representation as the animal moves and interacts with objects in the environment.
4. Experiment with the different models (full Bayesian, dynamic tracking, and noisy tracking) to see how they affect the accuracy of the spatial model.

## Impact:
This research underscores a critical gap in our understanding of spatial cognition in animals, particularly how neural mechanisms may fall short of enabling precise 3D representation. The implications of this work extend to various fields, including neuroscience, robotics, and cognitive science, as it challenges the foundational assumptions of classical neural models and encourages exploration of alternative approaches, such as wave-based representations of spatial data. Understanding these limitations could lead to significant advances in artificial intelligence and models of cognition that more accurately reflect biological processes.
