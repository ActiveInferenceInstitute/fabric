# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion focuses on three-dimensional spatial cognition in bees and bats, challenging classical neuroscience with a computational model of 3D space.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Robert Warden presents on spatial cognition in small animals, specifically bees and bats.
2. Classical neuroscience assumes neurons alone handle all cognitive tasks, but this may be incorrect.
3. Neurons struggle to represent 3D space due to imprecision and slowness.
4. Animals may use Bayesian maximum likelihood models to understand their 3D environment.
5. The demonstration program models 3D spatial cognition through various computational methods.
6. Dynamic object tracking and memory noise significantly affect spatial cognition accuracy.
7. The model suggests that a wave in the brain could help store spatial positions.
8. Insects' central bodies and mammalian thalamus shapes support the wave hypothesis.
9. The need for hybrid models combining neural and wave theories is emphasized.
10. Active inference trade-offs are crucial for understanding animal movement and spatial cognition.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Neurons alone may not adequately represent complex spatial information.
2. Animals likely rely on movement to enhance their spatial awareness.
3. A computational model can help test hypotheses about spatial cognition.
4. Understanding the neural basis of spatial cognition remains a significant challenge.
5. Future research should explore hybrid models combining neural mechanisms and wave theories.
