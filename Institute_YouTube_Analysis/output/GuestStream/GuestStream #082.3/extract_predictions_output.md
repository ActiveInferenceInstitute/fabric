- The projective wave theory of Consciousness will be discussed in detail.
- Evidence for a wave in the brain will be presented.
- The projective wave theory is expected to be tested in the next 10 years.
- The wave is hypothesized to store 3D spatial information in the brain.
- Spatial Consciousness will be linked to the wave hypothesis.
- The theory aims to address neural selection problems in Consciousness.
- Predictions about spatial Consciousness will be validated against experimental data.
