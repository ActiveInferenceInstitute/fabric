**Title:** Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness: A New Approach to Understanding Spatial Awareness

## Summary:
The Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness posits that consciousness arises from a wave-like structure in the brain that encodes 3D spatial information. This model attempts to resolve longstanding issues in neural theories of consciousness, such as the neural selection problem and the complexity of decoding sensory information.

## Description:
The Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness suggests that neurons alone do not account for consciousness; instead, it introduces the hypothesis that a wave in the brain, specifically in the thalamus, stores and represents 3D spatial information. This wave acts as a hologram, integrating sensory data and facilitating spatial cognition necessary for movement and awareness.

The theory builds on the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), which emphasizes the spatial nature of consciousness and its alignment with real-world geometry. While PCM accounts for some aspects of consciousness, it faces challenges common to neural theories, such as how to select neurons responsible for consciousness and how to accurately represent spatial information.

By proposing a wave-based model, the theory aims to overcome these challenges. The wave is thought to provide high capacity, precision, and low distortion in representing spatial information, thus aligning closely with conscious experience.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Review existing literature on the Projective Consciousness Model and the proposed wave hypothesis in the brain.
2. Conduct empirical studies that explore the role of the thalamus in spatial awareness and consciousness.
3. Design experiments to test the predictions of the Projective Wave Theory by manipulating sensory inputs and measuring changes in conscious spatial awareness.

## Impact:
If validated, the Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness could revolutionize our understanding of how consciousness is structured and experienced. It presents a testable scientific framework that could lead to significant advancements in neuroscience and cognitive science by providing a clearer picture of how spatial awareness influences consciousness and behavior.
