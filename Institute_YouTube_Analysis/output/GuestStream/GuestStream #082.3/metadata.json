  "description": "\"The Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness\"\nRobert Worden with David Rudrauf, Kenneth Williford, and Karl Friston\n\nThe Projective Wave Theory is a development of the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), in  which consciousness arises from a wave excitation in the thalamus. The theory is described, and its relationship to the PCM is discussed, with some of the developers of the PCM.\n\nRobert Worden\nhttps://bayeslanguage.org/\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
