SUMMARY
- Robert Warden presents the projective wave theory of consciousness, discussing its framework, data, and implications.

IDEAS:
- The projective wave theory of consciousness integrates spatial cognition and neural processes.
- Any theory of consciousness must align with empirical data for validation.
- Spatial consciousness is posited as a primary form of data for testing consciousness theories.
- The projective consciousness model (PCM) predicts spatial awareness better than many neural theories.
- Classical neural models face challenges like neural selection and precision in spatial representation.
- The wave hypothesis introduces a non-neural component crucial for consciousness.
- Consciousness could be linked to a wave in the brain storing 3D spatial information.
- Evidence for a wave includes anatomical structures like the thalamus and insect central body.
- The proposed wave can integrate sensory data to form a coherent spatial model.
- The theory emphasizes a Bayesian balance between assumptions and data fitting in consciousness models.
- Consciousness may evolve to represent spatial cognition accurately for survival.
- The unity of consciousness is maintained through a single wave model.
- Emotions may be spatially represented and linked to cognitive processes.
- The wave theory provides a scientific basis for investigating consciousness as opposed to purely philosophical.
- The concept of the hard problem of consciousness is acknowledged but not resolved by this theory.
- Future research could focus on computational models to explore consciousness representation.
- The theory suggests that both quantum and classical mechanics may inform our understanding of consciousness.
- The relationship between spatial awareness and emotions is a potential area for future exploration.
- Consciousness is theorized to be a function of the spatial wave’s properties and interactions.
- The model may lead to the development of artificial intelligence that mimics human-like consciousness.

INSIGHTS:
- Theories of consciousness must provide a positive Bayesian balance to be credible.
- Spatial consciousness offers rich data for testing theories, surpassing other forms of data.
- The PCM's strength lies in its predictive capabilities concerning spatial cognition.
- The wave hypothesis could resolve issues inherent in classical neural models.
- Understanding spatial cognition is vital for comprehending consciousness and its evolution.
- Emotional experiences are intertwined with spatial awareness, adding complexity to consciousness models.
- The integration of sensory data through a wave could redefine our understanding of conscious experience.
- The projective wave theory emphasizes the necessity of a scientific approach to studying consciousness.
- Future research may validate or falsify the wave hypothesis, shaping the discourse on consciousness.
- The hard problem of consciousness remains a significant challenge across all theories.

QUOTES:
- "Any Theory of Consciousness has to fit the data."
- "Spatial Consciousness is like a 3D model of the real world around you."
- "Neurons don’t do everything; there is a wave in the brain which stores 3D spatial information."
- "The PCM has a good Bas in Balance."
- "The wave acts as a working memory for space; it’s like a hologram."
- "Consciousness is determined by the wave and has evolved to be like the real world."
- "The wave theory makes consciousness a scientific problem rather than a philosophical one."
- "If there’s no wave, then this theory is wrong."
- "Our conscious model of space is very detailed and precise."
- "The unity of consciousness is maintained through a single wave in the brain."
