# SUMMARY
Robert Warden presents the projective wave theory of consciousness, discussing its relationship with the projective consciousness model and fitting data about spatial consciousness.

# IDEAS:
- The projective wave theory of consciousness connects consciousness with spatial data representation in the brain.
- Spatial consciousness is essential for understanding the model of consciousness presented by Robert Warden.
- The projective consciousness model (PCM) accounts for spatial nature better than many neural theories of consciousness.
- A Bayesian balance is crucial for any theory of consciousness to fit data effectively.
- Consciousness has a spatial model reflecting the real world, aiding in understanding and movement.
- The PCM has three major difficulties common to neural theories of consciousness, requiring additional assumptions.
- The notion that neurons alone do not account for all aspects of consciousness is a fundamental idea.
- A wave in the brain could store three-dimensional spatial information essential for consciousness.
- The PCM's predictions about spatial consciousness align well with empirical data on conscious experiences.
- The brain's thalamus may play a critical role in holding the proposed wave representing spatial information.
- Consciousness is a private experience, making it challenging to gather public data for testing theories.
- The relationship between consciousness and evolution is significant, suggesting that consciousness has adapted over time.
- The concept of neural selection is problematic, as not all neurons contribute to consciousness.
- The ability to represent 3D space in consciousness requires high precision, which traditional neural models struggle with.

- Integrating sensory data is vital for the thalamus to produce a Bayesian model of the current environment.
- The complexity of decoding from distorted brain models back to conscious experience presents significant challenges.
- The wave hypothesis may lead to new scientific avenues for understanding consciousness beyond philosophical debates.
- The unity of consciousness can be explained by the existence of a single wave in the brain.
- Investigating the nature of this wave is essential for advancing our understanding of consciousness.
- The existence of consciousness could be framed as a scientific problem rather than a philosophical one.

# INSIGHTS:
