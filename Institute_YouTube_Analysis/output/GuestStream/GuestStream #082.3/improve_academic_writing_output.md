**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome, everyone. Today is July 22nd, 2024, and this is Active Inference Guest Stream 82.3, featuring a presentation on the Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness by Robert Warden. We are fortunate to have several esteemed guests joining us for commentary and insights. Thank you all for being here, and Robert, please commence your presentation. Additionally, Robert, kindly close the YouTube stream on your end, as it is being echoed through my loudspeaker, which poses a challenge.

This presentation will delve into the Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness, for which a paper is already available on arXiv this month. I will outline the roadmap for today’s discussion. The Projective Wave Theory is intricately linked to the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), and we are privileged to have three of its authors present today. 

The talk will be divided into four parts. The first part will address data, emphasizing that any theory of consciousness must correspond to some empirical data for it to be credible. I will argue that the primary type of data available regarding consciousness pertains to spatial consciousness. 

In the second part, I will discuss the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), highlighting its significant advantage in predicting and accounting for the spatial nature of consciousness. It outperforms many neural theories of consciousness in this regard. After covering the first two points, I will pause for discussion. 

While I acknowledge the strengths of the PCM, I will also point out three challenges it shares with all neural theories of consciousness. I will emphasize that these challenges are not unique to the PCM; if one subscribes to the classical neural model of the brain, which posits that neurons are solely responsible for consciousness, these issues are likely to arise regardless of the theory. To overcome these challenges, we must introduce an assumption that diverges from the classical neural model: the hypothesis that there exists a wave in the brain that encodes three-dimensional spatial information, suggesting that neurons do not account for everything.

In the fourth part of the presentation, I will integrate the previous sections into a cohesive Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness, addressing how it resolves the neural issues and aligns with the empirical data, while also discussing broader implications.

We will begin by exploring the rationale for accepting a theory of consciousness or any theory in general. Fundamentally, we believe in a theory because it aligns with empirical data. There exists a complexity measure that must balance the assumptions embedded within a theory and the data it can accommodate. Theories established in fields such as physics or chemistry possess a significantly positive balance, characterized by few assumptions and the ability to account for extensive data. 

The question arises: what data do we possess to evaluate theories of consciousness? A significant challenge is that consciousness is a private experience, leading to limited public data. However, we can utilize various types of data, including levels of consciousness, states of alertness, sleep, and qualitative experiences (qualia). While these aspects are inherently subjective, individuals can nonetheless agree on similarity scales of their qualia, such as the similarity or difference between various colors. 

The spatial characteristics of consciousness represent a crucial manifestation of our conscious experience, which provides a detailed and accurate three-dimensional model of the surrounding world. This model possesses substantial informational content. Additionally, there are elements of conscious imagination, self-awareness, and the existence of consciousness itself, which contribute to our understanding of spatial consciousness. 

I will argue that the spatial aspect of consciousness offers significantly more data for testing any theory compared to other forms of data. Spatial consciousness is akin to a three-dimensional model of the external world that we experience. The geometry inherent in this model corresponds to the real world, allowing for tests of this agreement. For example, straight lines perceived in consciousness align with straight lines in reality, a relationship that can be empirically verified.

This correspondence between our conscious experience, which is information-rich, and the external world, which is also rich in information, provides substantial data for evaluating theories of consciousness. I suggest that this alignment may yield thousands of bits of testable information even within a few seconds, a claim that no other form of data concerning consciousness approaches in terms of testable informational content.

Thus, spatial consciousness emerges as the most critical element in any theory of consciousness. Understanding how the brain processes spatial cognition is paramount, as all animals, including insects, must comprehend three-dimensional space to navigate and control their movements effectively. There has been substantial evolutionary pressure for this capability, and it appears that a significant portion of the animal brain is dedicated to spatial understanding.

If we assume a Bayesian hypothesis regarding cognition, animals likely construct a maximum likelihood three-dimensional model of their local environment based on sensory data. It follows that spatial consciousness is likely connected to this spatial model. The question then arises: is this model purely neural, as proposed by classical neural theories, and if so, how do neurons encode three-dimensional space? This represents a complex issue with few viable solutions.

I will now shift focus to the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), developed by David and his collaborators since around 2017. The PCM is predicated on the free energy principle and assumes that the brain maintains a three-dimensional projective transform model of local space. The PCM predicts that spatial consciousness mirrors this model and aligns well with empirical data. 

Notably, the PCM stands out among various consciousness theories, as it prominently emphasizes the spatial aspect of consciousness, rather than treating it as an afterthought. It also generates several predictions concerning consciousness illusions and predictive imagination, although I contend that these predictions are less significant than the fundamental alignment between the PCM and the spatial form of consciousness.

However, I must emphasize that the PCM encounters three major challenges—neural selection, neural precision and speed, and a complex decoding problem. These challenges are not exclusive to the PCM; they pertain to any neural theory of consciousness, such as Integrated Information Theory (IIT) or Global Workspace Theory.

To summarize the three challenges: 
1. **Neural Selection Problem**: Most neurons in the brain do not contribute to consciousness, as evidenced by cortical lesions that do not disrupt conscious experience. Neural theories assert that the activity of specific neurons produces consciousness, yet a physical basis for selecting these neurons remains elusive.
2. **Neural Precision and Speed**: Conscious spatial models are highly detailed and precise; however, it is questionable whether neural firing can achieve such precision.
3. **Complex Decoding Problem**: Conscious experience, as evidenced by the relationship between reality and conscious awareness, is frequently based on distorted two-dimensional models. The brain's models are complex encodings that require intricate decoding to reconstruct conscious experience.

I will elaborate on these three challenges shortly, as they are significant considerations for any neural theory of consciousness, including the PCM. 

Having covered the first two parts of this presentation, I now invite discussion and contributions from the audience. Thank you, Robert, for your insightful presentation thus far. 

I find your discussion very compelling and would like to address the perspective of the PCM. Although we have framed the PCM within the context of active inference and the free energy principle, it does not imply an endorsement of current neural network models. As a neuroscientist with experience in electrophysiology, lesion work, and functional imaging, I have concluded that our understanding of the brain remains insufficient. Consequently, I have shifted my focus from attempting to create realistic neural network models.

I believe the primary significance of the PCM lies in its capacity to capture essential aspects of phenomenology. I have grown skeptical of our understanding of the brain and suggest that analogous to computer science, there exist layers of abstraction that obscure the details of the hardware. Thus, at this stage, the PCM remains neutral regarding the brain's precise mechanisms.

I concur with your observations, Robert, regarding the complexities of neural activity. While we acknowledge the intricate nature of neuronal function, it is plausible that there may be additional elements at play. Carl, do you have any comments at this juncture?

Thank you, I would like to follow up. I entirely agree with David's perspective. My approach has always been somewhat agnostic regarding the underlying realization of consciousness. I have primarily focused on phenomenology while maintaining a general acceptance of physicalism, albeit with uncertainty regarding its specifics. 

I have tended to view quantum mechanical theories of consciousness with skepticism, yet I remain open to possibilities. It is essential to acknowledge that our understanding of the brain and the physical universe is limited. We should strive to develop models based on phenomenology and empirical data to derive testable hypotheses regarding consciousness.

Furthermore, I appreciate the significance of the spatial component of consciousness. The PCM aims to account for various aspects of consciousness, including illusions and imaginative planning. We have even explored self-awareness within this context.

I am intrigued by the notion of the hard triangle you presented, which suggests that conscious experience represents a faithful model of the real world, while brain models may be distorted. Understanding the relationship between conscious awareness and the brain's representations is crucial. If the brain's models are distorted, we face challenges in decoding consciousness accurately.

I would like to emphasize the importance of exploring the distinction between principles governing how the brain perceives the world and the processes that manifest those principles. I find the focus on process theory particularly fascinating, especially regarding the potential for simulating inference in artificial intelligence.

In summary, I look forward to further discussions on these topics and the potential implications of the wave theory in understanding consciousness.

Moving on to the next part of the presentation, I will introduce the hypothesis that there exists a wave in the brain that represents three-dimensional space. This wave is posited to exist within a nearly spherical region of the brain and interacts with neurons. The hypothesis suggests that this wave serves as a working memory for spatial information, akin to a hologram.

One concern regarding this model is the challenge of representing distant objects, which may require a projective transformation to accurately encode spatial information within the brain. Evidence supporting this hypothesis will be discussed in a future YouTube live stream.

The wave model can represent numerous spatial positions and provides a high degree of precision. It exhibits low spatial distortion and functions similarly to a hologram, enabling efficient representation of space. 

I believe there are three lines of evidence supporting the existence of this wave: 
1. **Computational Neuroscience**: Spatial cognition is critical, yet traditional neural memory systems struggle with precision and speed. A wave-based model may address these limitations.
2. **Anatomical Evidence**: The thalamus, a spherical region in mammals, is well connected for processing spatial information. Similarly, the insect brain contains a central body that exhibits a spherical shape and is well-connected.
3. **Theoretical Evidence**: The anatomical configuration of the thalamus suggests a wave-like structure; its functionality becomes clearer when we assume the presence of a wave.

In conclusion, I posit that this wave is fundamental to understanding consciousness, and if we can establish its existence, it will provide significant insights into the nature of consciousness. I welcome any further questions or comments from the audience regarding this hypothesis.
