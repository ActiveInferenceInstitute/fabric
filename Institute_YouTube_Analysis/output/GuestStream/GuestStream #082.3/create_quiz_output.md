Subject: Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness
* Learning objective: Understand the relationship between data and consciousness theories.
    - Question 1: What types of data are essential for validating a theory of consciousness, and how does spatial consciousness fit into this framework?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Explain the Bayesian balance mentioned in the presentation and its significance in assessing consciousness theories.
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: Discuss the implications of consciousness being a private experience on the development of theories of consciousness.
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Analyze the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM) and its strengths and weaknesses.
    - Question 1: What are the primary strengths of the Projective Consciousness Model compared to traditional neural theories of consciousness?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Identify and elaborate on the three main problems that the PCM shares with classical neural theories of consciousness.
    - Answer 2:

    - Question 3: How does the PCM's emphasis on spatial consciousness differentiate it from other theories of consciousness?
    - Answer 3:

* Learning objective: Explore the concept of a wave in the brain and its implications for consciousness.
