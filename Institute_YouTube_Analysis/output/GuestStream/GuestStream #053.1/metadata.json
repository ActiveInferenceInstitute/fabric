  "description": "A case for chaos theory inclusion in neuropsychoanalytic modeling\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15294145.2023.2191983\nAlexey Tolchinsky\n\nDiscussion with: \nMark Solms, Andrea Clarici, Albert D'hulst, Bryn O\u2019Reilly\n\nThis paper provides a review of the current evidence of chaoticity at various scales of the brain\u2013mind as well as the application of nonlinear tools in clinical practice. Based on these data, a hypothesis is formulated that the brain\u2013mind at various scales can operate in linear, nonlinear, or hybrid modes, such as chaotic functioning accompanied by noise. A thesis formulated by Mark Solms that living systems must minimize Shannon\u2019s entropy of physical states (sensory entropy) is considered. Based on the data presented in this paper, minimization of entropy in that sense appears to be describing only a part of the complex brain\u2013mind dynamics. Studies evaluating measures of entropy specifically developed for real living systems such as discrete timescale entropy (ApEn) suggest that a decrease in EEG entropy can be observed in some neuronal processes (e.g. progression from wakefulness to deep sleep); however, EEG entropy is observed to be increasing at other times and in other modes of brain\u2013mind functioning (e.g. progression from deep sleep to REM to wakefulness; and from vegetative state to wakefulness). The clinical implications are discussed. This paper proposes that it would be theoretically and clinically beneficial for future revisions of neuropsychoanalytic models to consider including the chaos theory framework.\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
