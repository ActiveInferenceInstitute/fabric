**Title:** Implementing Meta Representations in Neural Networks to Understand Consciousness

## Summary:
This report discusses the challenges and insights related to implementing higher-order theories of consciousness through neural networks, particularly focusing on the concept of meta representations as representations of processes rather than static states.

## Description:
The presentation outlines a constructivist approach to understanding consciousness by examining higher-order theories, which suggest that a mental state is conscious not only through direct processing but also through a representation of that processing. The challenge arises in implementing these theories in neural networks, as traditional approaches result in vagueness. 

To overcome this, the proposal is to represent processes as functions within neural networks, creating a meta representation that captures the qualitative differences across various stimuli (e.g., visual vs auditory). The research explores the construction of a 'meta encoder' that allows for a representation of neural networks themselves, capturing their function and structure.

The experiment involved training multiple first-order neural networks on different types of stimuli (visual and auditory) and then creating meta encoders to visualize and analyze the latent representations. The results indicated a distinct separation between visual and auditory modalities, suggesting that meta representations can convey information about the nature and specialization of neural networks.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Train a set of first-order neural networks on various categories of stimuli (e.g., images of flowers, sounds of dogs barking).
2. Create a meta encoder that takes the outputs from these first-order networks as input.
3. Visualize the meta representations using techniques such as t-SNE to analyze the separations and clusters between different modalities.

## Supporting Material/References:

## Impact:
This research provides a novel approach to understanding the qualitative aspects of consciousness and how different sensory experiences can be represented and compared. By framing meta representations in terms of processes rather than static states, it opens up new avenues for empirical investigation into the nature of consciousness and its underlying neural mechanisms.
