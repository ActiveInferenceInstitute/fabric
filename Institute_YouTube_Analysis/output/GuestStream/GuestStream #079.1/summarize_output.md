# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The discussion focuses on meta representations in consciousness theories, emphasizing their implementation via neural networks and their potential implications.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Meta representations are crucial for understanding processes in consciousness theories.
2. Higher order theories of consciousness suggest awareness arises from mental state representations.
3. Implementing meta representations in neural networks reveals conceptual vagueness.
4. Confidence reports in cognitive neuroscience offer insights into meta representation.
5. The proposed meta encoder represents neural networks as functions rather than static states.
6. Experiments show distinct separations between visual and auditory stimulus networks.
7. Meta representations help evaluate similarities and differences in sensory experiences.
8. Global workspace theory may integrate multimodal representations for conscious awareness.
9. The relationship between confidence and consciousness needs further empirical exploration.
10. Future research aims to identify meta representations in biological brains.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Meta representations enhance understanding of consciousness by providing structured assessments of experiences.
2. Implementing theories of consciousness in neural networks can clarify abstract concepts.
3. Confidence plays a significant role in conscious experience and should be studied further.
4. The distinction between visual and auditory processing networks highlights the complexity of sensory integration.
5. The ongoing research may yield valuable insights into the nature of consciousness and cognition.
