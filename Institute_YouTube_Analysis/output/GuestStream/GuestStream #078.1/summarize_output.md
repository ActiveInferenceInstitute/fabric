# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The presentation discusses the relationship between phenomenology and cognitive science, focusing on temporality and intentionality in consciousness.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Phenomenology examines consciousness through a first-person perspective to uncover invariant structures.
2. Intentionality is broadened in phenomenology, emphasizing openness to the world beyond mere directedness.
3. Temporality is fundamental to understanding consciousness, framing all experiences as unfolding over time.
4. Husserl's triadic structure of time consciousness involves retention, primal impression, and protention.
5. Affection is a precondition for attention, influencing how objects solicit our consciousness.
6. Neurophenomenology seeks to bridge phenomenology and neurobiology, starting with the study of time consciousness.
7. Active inference integrates phenomenological insights with cognitive science, emphasizing dynamic interactions with the environment.
8. The relationship between affectivity and temporality is crucial for understanding human consciousness and behavior.
9. Depression exemplifies how disturbances in affectivity and temporality can impair one's engagement with the world.
10. Theoretical frameworks must evolve to account for both subjective and objective dimensions of consciousness.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Understanding consciousness requires integrating phenomenology and cognitive science perspectives.
2. Intentionality encompasses both active attention and passive affection, shaping our experiences.
3. Temporal consciousness is essential for grasping the flow of lived experiences.
4. Affection and temporality co-emerge, influencing how we anticipate and engage with the world.
5. Addressing mental health conditions like depression highlights the interplay of affectivity and temporality.
