**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome. Today is April 3rd, 2024, and we are convened for Active Inference Guest Stream 78.1. In this session, we will explore the concept of what may precede time, featuring a presentation by Juan Diego Bogota, followed by a discussion. I appreciate your participation and look forward to an engaging session. Thank you, Daniel.

Hello everyone, my name is Ju, and today I will primarily discuss phenomenology, rather than active inference, although our conversation may naturally gravitate in that direction. To provide some context, this presentation is based on a paper I recently published in *Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences* last month. Generally, I am interested in the relationship between cognitive science and phenomenology. 

When I refer to phenomenology, I am aware that the term can be ambiguous in the literature. Philosophers of mind or cognitive scientists may associate it with concepts such as qualia or the subjective experience of phenomenal consciousness, which is acceptable. However, I typically refer to a specific philosophical tradition known as phenomenology, which originated in the early 20th century with Edmund Husserl and was further developed by figures such as Martin Heidegger and Simone de Beauvoir. The primary aim of phenomenology is to provide a rigorous analysis of consciousness and lived experience by taking the first-person perspective seriously. This methodology seeks to unveil the invariant structures of consciousness, and I believe it holds promise for enhancing our understanding of consciousness and cognition, potentially enriching our scientific comprehension of the mind.

A valuable way to connect phenomenology with the broader context of cognitive sciences is through the inactive approach. Scholars like Francisco Varela and Evan Thompson have been significantly influenced by phenomenologists, particularly concerning ideas such as embodiment, the embeddedness of cognition, and the significance of subjectivity. In this talk, I will focus on a shared characteristic of these two frameworks: their conceptualization of intentionality. 

In cognitive science and philosophy of mind, intentionality typically refers to the directedness or aboutness of certain mental states, signifying a relationship between the mind and specific objects in the world. This understanding, however, is often too narrow. I argue that phenomenologists and many active inference theorists adopt a broader conceptualization of intentionality, viewing it not only as this directedness but also as a general openness to the world. The goal of phenomenology is to identify the structures that constitute this openness.

In classical phenomenology, one notable feature of lived experience is its primacy of temporality, or what Husserl refers to as time consciousness. I would like to share a quote from Husserl regarding this concept: he states that in the constitution of all objectivity given to consciousness, "time consciousness is the basis, as we might say, of a universal formal framework in which all other possible syntheses must participate." This elaborate statement emphasizes that to understand consciousness from a first-person perspective, one must first analyze temporality, which serves as the foundation of consciousness.

We typically experience events as unfolding in time, and consciousness itself is a stream that unfolds temporally. Thus, temporality is a fundamental structure of consciousness. Upon further analysis of Husserl's concept of temporality, one can discern a triadic structure of time consciousness. He posits that the living present—how we experience the present moment—is an integration of the past, present, and future. This includes the just past (retention), the immediate present (primal impression), and the anticipated future (protention). These operations of consciousness exhibit complex interrelations, contributing to the flowing nature of consciousness as it temporally unfolds.

The concept of retention reflects the experience of the just past, while protention pertains to the anticipation of what is forthcoming. Regardless of whether the experience fulfills or negates our anticipations, it ultimately sinks into the past, a process known as retentional modification. Thus, we observe a continuous flow of time, with consciousness moving from the future into the past. Importantly, this constitution of the living present can be understood as pretemporal or atemporal, as these processes are constitutive of our experience of time itself.

Husserl acknowledges that the structure of time consciousness is an abstraction, a formal framework that requires qualitative content for a comprehensive understanding of consciousness. This leads us to the concept of affection. For Husserl, affection is the lure that objects exercise on consciousness, drawing attention to themselves. Affection occurs when elements within our perceptual field solicit our attention, creating a tendency to focus on certain stimuli.

This relationship between affection and attention establishes the foundation of intentionality. Attention requires prior affection, as an object must first affect us before we can direct our focus toward it. To illustrate affection, consider the flag of Japan: the stark contrast between the red circle and the white background captures our attention due to its visual prominence. Conversely, in a chaotic artwork by Jackson Pollock, multiple colors may compete for attention without any single element standing out.

Affection, therefore, plays a critical role in how we experience the world. For something to be experienced, it must first affect us. This relationship reveals that temporality provides the framework for organizing experiential content, while affection is essential for the experience itself. I connect Husserl's concept of affection to the broader notion of affectivity, as defined by Jovana Coletti. Affectivity encompasses a lack of indifference, suggesting that when something affects us, we are no longer indifferent to it.

Husserl and other classical phenomenologists assert that affection presupposes time consciousness, as it must occur within the impressional present. Furthermore, it affirms our orientation towards the future, indicating that affection is intertwined with protention. This connection suggests that if we are to conduct cognitive science or consciousness research, we should prioritize temporality.

Interestingly, Varela's neurophenomenological approach integrates phenomenological research with neurobiological studies by establishing reciprocal constraints between the two domains. The first neurophenomenological study conducted by Varela focused on time consciousness, which he considered an acid test for the neurophenomenological project. However, there are distinctions between how Varela and Husserl conceptualize temporality. Husserl views temporality as an abstract formal framework, while Varela asserts that embodied activity grounds temporality in lived experience.

For Varela, the experience of time arises from our embodied interactions with the world, as illustrated by the "duck-rabbit" illusion. The shifting perception between a duck and a rabbit exemplifies how our perception changes over time through minimal and often unnoticed actions. This perspective aligns with the notion that we must examine embodied activity to understand the temporal unfolding of perception.

The goal of neurophenomenology is to investigate the neural dynamics underlying embodied activity. Varela posits that the dynamics governing embodied activity will likely mirror the temporal structures of consciousness as analyzed by Husserl. This relationship suggests that neurodynamics and phenomenology can inform one another, leading to a deeper understanding of consciousness.

A key distinction arises between Husserl's and Varela's views on protention. While Husserl considers protention the mirror opposite of retention, Varela suggests that protention is marked by affective tonality. In a 1999 paper, Varela illustrates this by describing the frustration experienced when searching for the right words, highlighting the connection between anticipation and affective states.

There are two ways to further elaborate on this idea. First, we can draw from later analyses of emotion, particularly those by Evan Thompson and Jovana Coletti, who emphasize the integration of neural processes, attention, evaluation, and bodily arousal in understanding emotion. For instance, Walter Freeman's dynamic architecture of the limbic system reveals causal loops between sensory systems, the hippocampus, the motor system, and the environment, suggesting that action perception is a co-constitutive process.

Thompson's work indicates that the relationship between the motor and sensory systems must involve a state of expectancy, as sensory systems prepare for the consequences of actions. This notion aligns with claims in the active inference literature. Thompson further connects these neural processes to what phenomenologists describe as protention, establishing a connection between temporality, emotion, and affectivity.

The 2005 paper by Banda and colleagues extends this analysis by examining the experiential level of affection. They propose a concept they call "micro-temporality," which captures the rapid integration of events, including the emergence of salience and the effective tonality of experiences. This micro-temporality implies that affection precedes temporality, as it generates a tendency that can only manifest in time.

This assertion raises an interesting question: how can affection precede temporality if it operates within time? I believe that we can address this by maintaining a focus on the experiential level. When we acknowledge the interplay between affection and temporality, we can better understand how they co-emerge. For example, in the context of depression, individuals may experience a flattening of the field of relevant affordances, resulting in a lack of motivation and a sense of being "time-locked." This illustrates the relationship between affectivity and temporality, as both dimensions can become disturbed in depressive states.

In conclusion, we may ask how affection can precede temporality if it is bound by time. By anchoring our analysis in phenomenology, we can explore the neural underpinnings of consciousness while acknowledging the co-emergence of temporality and affectivity. As such, we can assert that while nothing may come before time, it is inextricably linked to affection.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.
