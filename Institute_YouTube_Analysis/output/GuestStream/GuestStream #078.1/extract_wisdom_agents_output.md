SUMMARY
- Juan Diego Bogata discusses phenomenology's relation to cognitive science, emphasizing temporality's role in consciousness and intentionality.

IDEAS:
- Phenomenology provides a rigorous analysis of consciousness through first-person perspectives.
- Consciousness is characterized as a stream that unfolds temporally.
- Temporality is essential for understanding the structure of consciousness.
- The triadic structure of time consciousness includes retention, primal impression, and protention.
- Affection serves as a precondition for attention, highlighting its role in intentionality.
- The distinction between affection and attention reveals deeper layers of consciousness.
- Understanding consciousness requires examining both temporal and affective dimensions.
- Affection precedes temporality, suggesting a complex relationship between the two.
- Neurophenomenology integrates phenomenology with neurobiological research to deepen understanding of consciousness.
- Active inference models can bridge phenomenological and biological perspectives.
- The interplay between affectivity and temporality shapes our experiences and perceptions.
- Depression illustrates the connection between reduced affectivity and temporality.
- The foreground/background structure in perception emphasizes the role of affection in attention.
- The world presents itself as a field of relevant affordances shaped by affectivity.
- Object intentionality and operative intentionality provide different lenses for understanding consciousness.
- Empirical research can enhance phenomenological insights into consciousness and cognition.
- The dynamic interplay between body, environment, and cognition shapes our understanding of intentionality.
- Addressing the ontology of active inference requires integrating phenomenological insights with changing realities.
- Different temporalities exist, including subjective time and objective time.
- Understanding biological cognition can benefit from phenomenological approaches.
- The distinction between active and passive intentionality enriches the exploration of consciousness.

INSIGHTS:
- The connection between temporality and affection is fundamental for understanding consciousness.
- Emphasizing phenomenology can provide a basis for empirical research in consciousness studies.
- The interplay of affectivity and temporality influences our perceptions and experiences of reality.
- Understanding the nuances of consciousness requires integrating both phenomenological and neurobiological perspectives.
- The experience of time shapes our consciousness and is essential for cognitive processes.
- Active inference can model the relationship between consciousness and the dynamic nature of reality.
- Phenomenology reveals invariant structures of consciousness that can inform biological cognition.
- The relationship between affectivity and temporality can illuminate experiences of mental health conditions.
- Consciousness evolves through a continuous interplay of past experiences and future anticipations.
- The distinction between foreground and background perception highlights the complexity of attentional processes.

QUOTES:
- "The first thing you have to analyze is temporality."
- "Consciousness itself is a stream of Consciousness."
- "Affection occurs when something in our perceptual field tries to catch our attention."
- "The world is first properly given and experienced through affection."
- "The whole point of phenomenology is to disclose invariant structures of consciousness."
- "Temporality provides the framework that organizes experiential content."
- "Affection presupposes the potential projection of bodily possibilities."
- "The relationship between affectivity and temporality is expressed as general feelings."
- "Depression illustrates how affection and temporality are disturbed."
- "Affection precedes temporality, suggesting a complex relationship between the two."

HABITS:
- Engaging with phenomenological analysis to deepen understanding of consciousness.
- Maintaining a connection between lived experience and empirical research.
- Exploring the interplay between affectivity and temporality in daily life.
- Practicing mindfulness to enhance awareness of affection and attention.
- Reflecting on personal experiences to inform theoretical insights.
- Keeping an open dialogue between different scientific perspectives.
- Recognizing the embodied nature of experiences and their implications.
- Utilizing interdisciplinary approaches to enrich understanding of consciousness.
- Continuously updating personal beliefs based on new insights and experiences.
- Fostering a habit of questioning assumptions in both science and philosophy.

FACTS:
- Phenomenology was founded by Edmund Husserl in the early 20th century.
- The concept of intentionality refers to the directedness of mental states.
- Time consciousness is considered fundamental to understanding consciousness.
- The living present integrates the past, present, and future experiences.
- Neurophenomenology seeks to integrate phenomenological research with neurobiological insights.
- Active inference models the relationship between cognition and environmental interactions.
- Depression can lead to a flattening of the field of relevant affordances.
- The concept of affordances describes the action possibilities presented by the environment.
- Object intentionality refers to the directedness of attention towards specific objects.
- Passive intentionality reflects a fundamental openness to the world.
