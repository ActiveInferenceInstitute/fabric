**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome, everyone. This is the Active Inference guest stream 88.1, taking place on September 17th, 2024. Today, we are joined by Hunar Abdul Raman, who will discuss the limits of our brains. There is an engaging backstory that we may explore. The session will include a presentation followed by a discussion, and I eagerly anticipate engaging with your comments and questions as well. Thank you, Hunar, for joining us today. Please feel free to provide any backstory and introduction before we begin your presentation.

Thank you, Daniel, for inviting me to this stream. This is actually my first time using this software for a live stream, so I hope the audience will forgive any technical issues that may arise. My name is Hunar, and I hold a PhD in Neuroscience. I have dedicated many years to understanding how the brain functions, utilizing techniques such as functional MRI and EEG. I completed my PhD at Cambridge University, where I focused on linking concepts learned about the brain with external concepts, including the free energy principle. I consider myself a newcomer to this principle and hope that those with a technical background will forgive any errors I may make. Nonetheless, I am excited to share my insights from my research over the past few years.

Can you see my slides? Great! The topic today revolves around the limits of our brain. I will discuss several concepts, beginning with the brain as a predictive machine, commonly described by the predictive coding framework. I will then relate this to the free energy principle and address the factors that complicate prediction. I will discuss extrinsic factors that present challenges, even if we possess the best learning algorithms or if our brain functions optimally in learning. A significant challenge stems from the principle of computational irreducibility, which I will elaborate on in the upcoming slides.

I would like to start with repetition suppression, a well-known concept in neuroscience. For those interested in details regarding repetition suppression, I recommend the article by my PhD supervisor, R. Hansen, although it may be challenging to grasp the results. Essentially, repetition suppression refers to the phenomenon where brain activity, recorded through methods such as EEG or fMRI, decreases upon repeated exposure to the same stimulus. For example, if one views a sequence of images of elephants followed by a novel image, such as a kangaroo, brain activity increases in response to the novel image. However, when the same image is presented repeatedly, brain activity diminishes, leading to what we term repetition suppression. This concept extends beyond simple repetition to include expectation suppression. Thus, when an expected stimulus is presented, brain activity decreases, whereas unexpected stimuli trigger an increase in activity. This relationship is evident in both repetition and expectation studies.

During my PhD, we encountered an intriguing paper titled "Less is More: Expectations Sharpen Representations in the Primary Cortex." This study sought to explain why repetition suppression occurs. The researchers tested various grating orientations, presenting subjects with both expected and unexpected orientations. They found that brain activity decreases when a stimulus is expected. Although this study focused on expectation rather than repetition, the results are analogous. Moreover, they examined classification accuracy, demonstrating that when repetition occurs, classification accuracy improves, suggesting that repetition sharpens the neural representation of the stimulus. This sharpening occurs as neurons that do not represent the repeated stimulus become less active.

In our own research, we analyzed two datasets: one involving images of faces versus scrambled faces, and another involving grating orientations. We observed that while repetition led to decreased brain activity, classification accuracy varied between the datasets. Specifically, for the face dataset, classification accuracy also decreased with repetition. This discrepancy prompted us to consider local scaling or local effects. We hypothesized that even if neurons representing a specific feature are suppressed, classification accuracy could still improve if we selectively suppress non-relevant neurons.

To simulate neural activity within the context of fMRI, we developed orientation curves to illustrate how sharpening occurs with repetition. We examined different models of suppression, including global and local effects, to better understand how repetition suppression manifests in neural activity. Our analysis revealed that local scaling best accounted for our findings, suggesting that neurons selectively representing a feature are suppressed more than non-relevant neurons during repetition.

Overall, our research indicates that the brain functions as a predictive machine, aligning with the predictive coding framework. We observed that the brain is less active in response to expected stimuli and exhibits increased activity in response to novel or unexpected stimuli. This raises questions about the limitations of our predictive capabilities, particularly in relation to computational irreducibility and the challenges of prediction in complex systems.

In conclusion, I appreciate the opportunity to present my research and engage in this discussion. I look forward to your questions and comments.
