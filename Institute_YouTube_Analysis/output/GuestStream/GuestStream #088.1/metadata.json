  "description": "Name: Hunar Ahmad Abdulrahman\nLecturer of Medical Physiology at Al-Kitab University, Iraq\n\nAccording to the Free Energy Principle and predictive coding theories, our brain is a prediction machine. Predicting future events in a changing environment is essential for adaptation and ultimately for our survival. On the other hand, the Computational Irreducibility Principle posits that accurate prediction for the far future is impossible. So how does our brain manage to make long-term predictions possible?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TT4I2VIPYrg?\n@brainxyz \n\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
