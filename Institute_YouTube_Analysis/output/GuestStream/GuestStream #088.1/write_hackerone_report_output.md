**Title:** Ineffective Prediction Mechanism in Neural Networks Leading to Catastrophic Forgetting

## Summary:
A flaw in the prediction mechanism of neural networks can result in catastrophic forgetting when the system encounters unexpected inputs. This vulnerability arises from the network's inability to manage prediction errors effectively, leading to instability and loss of previously learned information.

## Description:
The core issue stems from the neural network's approach to learning from input data. When the network is trained on a predictable sequence, it can effectively minimize prediction errors, as seen in simulations where a sinusoidal pattern is accurately predicted. However, when an unexpected event is introduced, such as a sudden change in the sequence, the network struggles to adapt, leading to an increase in prediction error.

This situation is analogous to the phenomenon of repetition suppression in neuroscience, where the brain's activity decreases for predictable stimuli but increases for novel or unexpected stimuli. The failure of neural networks to filter out noise and adapt to new data can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned information is overwritten by new, unrelated data. This is particularly problematic in real-time learning scenarios, where the network must quickly adapt without disrupting the entire system.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Implement a neural network using the provided code to simulate predictions based on a sinusoidal input.
2. Train the network on a predictable pattern and observe the prediction error as it learns.
3. Introduce an unexpected change in the input sequence (e.g., a sudden spike in the sinusoidal wave) and observe how the network's prediction error increases.
4. Analyze the network's activity levels to determine how the unexpected input affects its ability to learn and retain previous patterns.

## Supporting Material/References:

## Impact:
The inability of neural networks to effectively manage prediction errors when faced with unexpected inputs can lead to significant performance degradation, particularly in applications requiring real-time learning and adaptation. This vulnerability not only affects the accuracy of predictions but also poses a serious risk of losing critical previously learned information, undermining the reliability of AI systems in dynamic environments.
