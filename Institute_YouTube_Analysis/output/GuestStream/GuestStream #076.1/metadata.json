  "description": "Anna Pereira: \"Wellness Science through the Lens of Active Inference\"\n\nKarl Friston's citations already total more than half of Sigmund Freud, however, his name and the possible applications of Active Inference into our existence largely linger outside common knowledge.  This work looks to distill and simplify the complex science to enable a larger audience to reap its benefits in living their fullest potential (defined as living a fulfilling life and enabling others to do the same).  Active Inference is the key lens and process that ties together human anatomy, human needs/intentions, and the larger body of wellness science.  This talk will outline key findings and messaging at both the academic and personal level.  It also invites peer review, personal feedback, and invitations for possible collaboration.  \n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
