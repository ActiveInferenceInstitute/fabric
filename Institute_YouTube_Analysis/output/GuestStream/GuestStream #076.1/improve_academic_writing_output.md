**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome to the Active Inference Guest Stream 76.1. Today is March 26, 2024, and we have the pleasure of hosting Anna Pereira, who will discuss wellness science through the lens of active inference. The session will include both a presentation and a discussion; if you are watching live, we look forward to your questions. Thank you for joining us, and now I will hand over to Anna for the presentation.

Thank you, Daniel. It is indeed thrilling to be here, and I am excited to connect with this community and to observe the substantial work being undertaken in this field. I appreciate the opportunity to participate. I would like to note that this work is still in its nascent stages; thus, this draft represents an early iteration. We have made efforts to include key citations and images, but please be aware that this is a work in progress. I welcome feedback and am eager to discuss any potential collaborations that may arise from this endeavor. Most importantly, I hope that the lens and content of this presentation prove beneficial to each of you in your personal experiences.

I would like to begin with a personal narrative. One of the observations I hope you will make throughout this presentation is its mass consumer-oriented format, reminiscent of a TED Talk. You will see a greater emphasis on images and fewer words from me. If you require any citations that may not be included in this format, please feel free to message me. I typically start with a story.

In the past, I pursued a version of the American Dream, which led me to engage in excessive consumerism and socially accepted forms of numbing. This behavior was a way of escaping from elements of my past, which were deeply entrenched in my own active inference cycle. As a result, I often found myself feeling quite discontented. Active inference ultimately became the missing component in my quest to create a life that increasingly resembles my desired state of being. My goal with this work and presentation is not only to solicit your questions or insights but also to ease the path for others who wish to embark on similar journeys.

Now, let us delve into the content. I am confident that many of you are familiar with Carl Friston, whose intellect I consider unparalleled. An interesting fact is that his citations now total approximately half of those attributed to Sigmund Freud. While Freud's contributions may not be as robust scientifically as those of active inference, they have permeated common vernacular. My hope is to bridge the gap between the intricate beauty of this complex science and a more accessible language, thereby enabling individuals to lead more fulfilling lives and act upon their intentions.

As I simplify the model for clarity, I will keep many of the formulas in the background and present the images in more digestible forms. Given this audience, I will navigate through the content relatively swiftly, as I often find myself breaking it down in greater detail. I would like to highlight the current experience each of you is having as you observe this presentation. You are utilizing your senses to process my words, making inferences about their meaning, and preparing to act based on these interpretations. This process exemplifies active inference in real time.

Consider the example of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where a sudden noise may trigger an exaggerated sense of danger. In such instances, individuals may act defensively, having learned to associate certain stimuli with threats, regardless of their actual danger level. Similarly, anxiety disorders, which affect approximately one in five individuals, can lead to heightened sensitivity to perceived threats, prompting avoidance behaviors that further entrench the cycle of anxiety.

Active inference significantly influences our lives, as will be evident throughout this discussion. What I find particularly compelling about active inference is its robustness; it can instill a deep-seated belief in one's ability to navigate challenges. Even in moments of struggle, one can trust that this process operates within them, and by nurturing it, they can experience empowerment.

Let us explore some specific examples. It is essential to acknowledge that as humans, our anatomy and intentions play critical roles in our experiences. I find it helpful to adapt Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs into a Hierarchy of Intentions. At the foundational level, we have safety and psychological needs. For instance, my personal intention in this space is to enable myself, my family, and those around me. I encourage you to reflect on your intentions, as I believe they evolve over time, aligning with various learning theories regarding human maturation.

As we move up the hierarchy, we encounter psychological needs such as belonging and esteem, which emphasize the importance of fostering community and relationships. Ultimately, self-actualization encompasses personal achievement, the realization of one's highest potential, and contributing to the greater good. My intention is to live my fullest potential while enabling others to do the same. It is fascinating to observe how needs become more individualized as we ascend the hierarchy, which is why the excitement surrounding AI and wellness stems from its potential to provide accessible and tailored solutions.

I will now integrate some specific examples from diverse scientific fields. Emotions serve as signals that provide critical information about our environment. To illustrate, consider a Tesla vehicle operating with half of its sensors covered; this scenario parallels our experience when we distance ourselves from or deny our emotions. The goal is to learn how to effectively utilize these signals without becoming overwhelmed or trapped by them. Many individuals have found tools such as the emotion wheel and Bren√© Brown's book, "Atlas of the Heart," helpful in navigating difficult emotions. For instance, when I feel an emotion I cannot fully articulate, I can consult the emotion wheel to discern that I may not be feeling sad but rather isolated.

Moreover, the practice of meditation allows us to explore the subconscious aspects of our active inference cycle. Most of this cycle operates beneath our conscious awareness, which makes exploring this space particularly rewarding. Meditation is one avenue to achieve this, along with other methods such as mindful eating, sensory deprivation tanks, and various creative practices. Engaging with the subconscious can facilitate the dissolution of barriers between the mind and body, allowing us to slow the active inference cycle and view it from a different perspective.

I would like to reference the divided brain theory proposed by Michael Gazzaniga. While this model is highly simplified, it provides valuable insights into the integration of our experiences. In my past, I leaned heavily on left-brain thinking, focusing on logical and analytical processes, often neglecting the right-brain aspects of creativity and experience. Now, I intentionally engage both hemispheres through activities that stimulate both analytical and creative thinking. This holistic approach enables me to reach my fullest potential.

Journaling is another practice that can enhance our active inference cycle. When I encounter a challenging thought or experience, I find journaling to be particularly beneficial. This practice activates various parts of my brain involved in regulating emotions and problem-solving, thus fostering greater awareness and insight. 

At this point, I wish I could engage with you directly to address any questions. However, I will continue with my discussion. It is crucial to acknowledge the role of the body in our active inference cycle. I have often found myself in a state of disconnection, striving to meet societal expectations regarding body image. This disconnect became evident when my motivations for exercising stemmed from external validation rather than an integrated understanding of my body's needs. By shifting my intention to support my active inference cycle, I experienced a profound transformation in my relationship with exercise, discovering that my body could communicate valuable signals to my mind.

Another relevant concept is the Polyvagal Theory developed by Stephen Porges. This theory posits that our social engagement, fight-or-flight responses, and freeze responses are influenced by our perceptions of threat. For instance, when I engage with an audience, I aim to remain grounded, calm, and open, which allows me to communicate effectively. Conversely, anxiety and fear can disrupt this connection, impacting both our physiological states and the active inference cycle.

To illustrate the Polyvagal Theory, I invite you to reflect on your feelings of isolation versus belonging. This exercise allows us to experience the shifts in our physiological states as we engage with the concept of connection. Acknowledging our innate wiring as social beings is essential, particularly in a society that often fosters disconnection. If you are feeling lonely, it is important to recognize that this is a common experience, not a personal failing. 

Let us also consider mutualism and our connections with others. The concept of the Markov blanket can extend beyond the individual to encompass our partners, communities, and even pets. Active inference encourages mutualistic relationships that benefit all parties involved. For example, international aid systems mobilize collective efforts to support those in need, while mutualistic behaviors in gaming communities foster innovation and collaboration.

As we navigate rapid societal changes, it is imperative to enable our active inference cycles. By doing so, we can better manage challenges such as climate change and the integration of AI into our lives. It is essential to be intentional about how we nurture our active inference cycles, including being mindful of our social media consumption and the emotional content we engage with.

Practices such as gratitude journaling can enhance our overall well-being. By recognizing moments of gratitude, we can maintain balance and grounding amidst the complexities of the world. Exploring activities that invoke awe, wonder, and curiosity can also enrich our experiences.

Furthermore, it is vital to acknowledge the emotional burdens we carry and work through them. Forgiveness, for instance, does not necessarily mean welcoming negative experiences back into our lives; rather, it involves acknowledging and processing these experiences to facilitate healing.

Communication is another critical aspect of our active inference cycles. Given the limitations of our communication bandwidth, it is essential to cultivate effective communication skills. Strategies such as acceptance, self-compassion, and mindfulness can enhance our connections with others and facilitate our active inference processes.

In conclusion, I would like to share some personal reflections. My journey has taken me from a career in technology in the Bay Area to a more fulfilling life in Portugal, where I am focused on personal passion projects. Throughout this process, I have discovered that my active inference cycle has become more effective, allowing me to live a life rich in joy and connection.

As we explore the hierarchy of intentions, I am actively seeking to pursue this work outside traditional academic frameworks to foster community and belonging. I am open to collaborations and excited about the potential for social media campaigns that resonate with individuals. 

Thank you for your attention. I hope this presentation has provided valuable insights and inspiration for your own journeys.
