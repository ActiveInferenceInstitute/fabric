hello and welcome this is active inference guest stream 76.1 it's March 26th 2024 and we're here with Anna Pereira talking about Wellness science through the lens of active inference there will be a presentation and a discussion so if you're watching live looking forward to your questions thank you again for joining and to for the presentation thank you thank you Daniel it's certainly exciting to be here um and I was so excited to find this community to see all the work that's being done in this space and to have the opportunity to participate so thank you um quick note that this is all still I mean it feels like the active inference site um space is still young and so this draft is part of that so we've done our best to do key citations and images and stuff here but please know that this is all early and working and I'm excited to um get feedback and also to talk about any organic mutualistic uh collaborations that might come out of it but more than anything um I hope that you all each find the lens and the content of um this presentation helpful to yourself and and your own experience all right so with that I'll just go ahead and um dive in um I like to start with a story I think one of the things you'll notice about this presentation is it more in a mass consumer sort of format um something you might see at like a Ted type presentation um so you'll see more images and more words coming for myself and um message me if you want any of the citations uh that might not be covered uh in this sort of format but I typically like to open with a story so I used to um be chasing a version of the American dream um and I found that I was chasing a lot of consumerism doing a lot of socially acceptable numbing and running away from things um in my pastor that were actually even caught in my own individual active inference cycle and it left me feeling like this um more often then perhaps not and um active inference actually ended up being the key piece that was really missing as I created a life and experience a life that feels more and more like this more often um and so that's my goal of this work um and of this presentation like not only to borrow off of any questions or expertise that you all have or feel like sharing but also the path feels much easier for me now but in the past it was highly ineffective highly um C intensive time intensive um and so it's my hope to help make it smoother for others who wish to make similar Journeys uh and so that's what it is show some of this knowledge with you okay so uh to this group of people I'm sure I don't have to explain who this person is um but you know one of my favorite facts other than um I like to call Carl fren's mind the single most densely intelligent brain I've ever tried to step into um and uh yeah well we'll see what awards he ends up getting in the future is that um his citations now already total half of Sigman freuds and Freud is part while perhaps actually I could say factually not as robust science as active inferences it is a part of the common vernacular and so one of my hopes is is to be a bridge between the beauty of this really dense science that's happening to a more common vacular to help enable people to live more fulfilling lives and enact on their intentions so as I break down this model in a very simple way you'll see a lot of the formulas are kind of kept to the side and the the images themselves have been started to be distilled in very simple to understand sort of ways um so we can start to share share um this principle um yeah so given this audience I'm going to go through that fairly quickly usually usually I have to break this down a lot more there is one thing I'll I'll mention is it's really interesting to think about like your experience right now of what's happening I think we all know that you're using your eyes and your ears to watch me you're making inferences in your mind um about what I'm saying and then you're going to act based on that and then you're going to learn in your mind based on that so you're doing it right now and you can start to take things like um I think many of us have already thought about how PTSD right you hear a noise um you infer that you're in more danger than you probably are you act in a way to protect yourself and because your active inference cycle has already been so muddled you've now learned that you know that behavior pattern might protect you in the future inaccurately um learn that based on the the environment but you can also take things like um anxiety disorder right one in five people of us people will likely experience that so that means each of us who are watching it either have experienced it or know someone well who has and so you can see how that leads to a heightened sensitivity of perceived threats in the mind you're more apt to predict negative or threatening outcomes and then you're inclined to act out of fear based on that and then you're going to learn avoidance behaviors avoidance behaviors so you can see how active inference starts to affect our lives in a lot of ways and you'll see that theme through through the talk and one of the things I really like about active inference is it's so robust that you can create this deep belief in it in you so even in the moments when you're struggling the most you know that you have this process running within you and if you feed it if you address it it can be very enabling you can believe in it and then it can be very enabling for you okay so let's step into some specific examples or no wait actually I want to pull for one more thing um so we know a little bit of the process of how now as humans there's two more key components there's our anatomy and and um our intentions like what are we trying to do and why specific to humans so I like to take the hierarchy of needs marso's hierarchy of needs and change it to hierarchy of intentions so you have basic needs and brne Brown's work around some of this is also really helpful to pull in here um but down there you could be at like safety and psychological needs so if I were to share my specific intentions in this space as a way for example it would be to provide to enable myself family and those around me um and I'll give you a quick moment to maybe reflect on what yours are how you might slightly tweak those I do find that mine change over time which matches with various learning theory models of how we as humans can mature over time uh then you have the psychological so topics like belonging and esteem from our communities so one way I word that for myself specifically is to Foster family community thank you community for welcoming me right now and relationships that enables belonging in substance and then self-actualization which is a very broad term that encompasses things like Personal Achievement realization of one's highest capacities and contribution to the greater good so for me that's the intention of living my fullest potential by living a fulfilling life and enabling others to do the same and it's really interesting to think that the higher we go up the pyramid the more individualized the needs are um which is why I think some of the excitement around Ai and this larger space and wellness comes from because we now have a new tool that can help us to do that um and perhaps build on these principles to do that in a very accessible and individualized way okay so let's put this together in some um specific examples you see how we're pulling from a large breath of science um and uh fields of study so let's talk about emotions so the environment is full of uncertainty and emotions are this signal uh that is allowing it that is providing key information about the environment I almost consider um it to like a Tesla driving around uh with half its sensors covered up is when we uh distance ourselves or deny our emotions feelings the and and emotions I'm using very broadly here if you go if you dive into that field and includes states of body feelings emotions um so that larger space is like driving around with half of our sensors covered up and so it's starting to learn about how do we make use of these signals in effective ways not get bogged down on them not get them trapped and not deny them and so for many of us for or many of the people that um I've had a talk through a chance to talk with and in my own experience starting with things like the emotion wheel and Bernay Brown's book Atlas of the heart uh were two highly effective tools so for example um if I'm experiencing difficult emotion I don't fully understand I can feel it in my body I can feel pulling at the thoughts in my mind I walk over to the emotion wheel and I work my way down and I'm actually like oh I'm not feeling sad I'm feeling isolated or um even like today I'm feeling a type of fear but it's not overwhelm and it I don't know I was able to work through it to a point where I actually switched mov through those fears and ended up more and excited um although occasionally I still feel the fear a little bit but that's okay because I know that's a natural part of my cycle and I just let it go instead of getting caught behind it and then when I get really stuck I can go to ber Brown's book Atlas of the heart and she organizes these within sections and explains ways that we can work through them and then I can go ahead and process it maybe pull my journal out and work through it so finding ways as humans based on our anatomy our experiences to make use of those emotions in our active inference cycle so they don't get caught in the sense part of the cycle so we could even we can take this further into like the space of meditation you know if we think about the active inference cycle running within us very little of it is conscious the overwhelming majority of it is in the subconscious space and so that's what can be so beautiful about taking time to explore that space and there's a number of ways to do it um meditation is one that's quite popular and easy to access at the moment there's things like mindful eating um finding a sensor sensory deprivation tank people can even experience it in things like runner's high Dream journaling morning Pages um psychedelics is another space with a lot of research behind it at the moment um and so again as we think about our intentions for our life perhaps living to our fullest potential enabling others to do the same there's this idea of wow there's these other spaces we can get really wonderful experience and information from and exploring the subconscious thought is part of that and what you're essentially doing in that if you think about your active inference cycle is you're placing yourself in a safe environment where you don't have to think about it you're dissolving that barrier between your mind and your body and you're slowing the cycle so you're essentially looking at it from a different perspective and you're using different systems within your body okay so I'd like to pull in the divided brains uh Theory from Migel Christ in this audience is worth noting that it's highly simplified model I know if we were to get a group of neuroscientists in here we would talk about how this is oversimplified and there's a lot of things happening but I think when we want to think about distilling this to a high level and dissimulating it I think the science still holds really true um to the foundation in the larger picture of this as long as we pull in how important integration is um which we do touch on here um both here and in other parts uh but what's really great to think about the divided brain theory is that as a human we have this Anatomy we have this experience to be to dive deep into both and so I know in the past I was very left brain heavy very analogic anal analog scientific um sort of space but there's this whole right brain of like experience exping life and music and beauty that and creativity that we can also pull from uh and so now I intentionally exercise both I do activities that enable both so uh the on the left side it would be thing like Puzzles games math number related activities step-by-step instructions studying programming and coding and then the right would be more like creative activities time in nature musical instruments reading poetry run a little WhatsApp poetry group now um explore new places and activities and it's when we enable both that we're enabling our fullest Anatomy to our fullest potential so you can almost think about it as the active inference cycle illustrated by like half a mind versus a whole mind um so we can also think about the practice of journaling um and why again it's something that's sort of coming into the larger conversation at the moment why it can be so helpful for us and for example I can find journaling most helpful when I'm stuck on something um when it's something that's important to me it's in the way of my intentions or it's trying to inform my intentions or it keeps coming up in my thought process over and over again and so if I go pick up my journal and I spend some time writing about it what I'm essentially doing is I'm turning on different parts of my anatomy that enable my active infer cycle so I'm turning on the prefrontal cortex uh while I'm reflecting and writing about my thoughts uh which is involved that part of the brain is involved in regulating emotions and problem solving I'm also turning on things like the lyic system in the hip a campus which are helping with more emotional processing and um learning so essentially by changing my activity putting some Consciousness around the activity that I'm doing in my active inference cycle I'm enabling more awareness Insight in problem solving all right um this is about the point in time where I wish I could see you all and see if you had questions but I'll keep going do you know um you can reach out to me I'm sure we can figure out a way to put my email on this great okay so let's step um into the body a bit uh and talk about that um because it's a key part of the cycle uh and sometimes I find the way I think about it has made some big changes for me so I think if you're watching this talk you probably already know what you should be doing in order to enable your body so I don't want to spend a lot of time there instead what I do want to talk about is where some of us end up which is um an experience I used to have in the past I was trying to hold and do everything that I thought I needed to be doing um and sometimes for disenabling intentions and so for me if I think about it um I was a woman coming out of Western Society who often felt valued for the way I was perceived uh by others and so I would often work out as a way to try and entain the societal Norms of beauty that I as a woman felt that I needed to um obtain and so what ended up happening when I was working out I was really kind of disconnecting what my mind needed I wasn't doing it from this like fully integrated place I was chasing this idea of I need to do hard intense workouts that make my muscles look a certain way um in order to be valued by others and it was really draining and it was not sustainable in times of stress um instead I shifted my intention to work out to enable my active inference cycle I can be that Nerdy with this group I love that I can um and that was a really big shift for me I found when I was working out that my mind and my body integrated and connected a lot more I found that my body had helpful signals it could send my mind when I was working out like things around perfectionism or um over stress or strain in various areas um and it's turned into this really beautiful practice of enabling my active inference cycle and often as an extra bonus it does make my jeans fit a little bit better but that's really not the intention behind it um so I haven't really prepared that example from maybe um um a a nominal male perspective or a non-gender pafic example at the moment um but I wanted to share that as an example of how shifting our intentions and aligning it with a larger active inference cycle can help us enable ourselves in the area of our body okay so this is a really fun one um the poly Vago Theory uh of Stephan Fork's brilliant work in the space um starts to talk about how we connect with one another which then uh Builds on symbiotic relationships and how we um if we move the markof blanket from just us as individuals to larger communities so his uh says that we can essentially be in three different states we can be at the lower level of social engagement we can be in fight or flight or we can be in freeze and that is based on the perception of threat uh so Daniel thanks for helping me feel safe right now um and based on that perception of threat a whole um different systems in the body turn on and they're associated with each and based on those various nervous systems turning on along with a lot of other systems because this is a simplified um image we have different experiences so when I'm on the bottom which I try and stay and when I'm a talk in a talk because then I can be grounded calm curious open and compassionate like the message can come out in a very genuine way um when I'm in a place of anxiety frustration anger fear worry rage right you can see how it starts to break down and you can also now think about us being in community with one another right if I'm in conversation with you or you're having a conversation with a friend and they're feeling this anxiety frustration anger fear worry rage you can see how it gets in the way and then you can see how it gets in the way even more um when you go up even higher into disassociation numbness depression hopelessness um and the active inference cycle as a scientists this is when you just get so happy right you see two theories come together so beautifully you can see how it impacts the active inference cycle in each of those stages so when I'm grounded and calm in the bottom I I don't feel threatened I have the the physiological systems in my body running that most enable me my active inference cycle is running as it should as I feel more threatened and those other systems come on as I go to fight you can see my active inference really move between my body and the environment or flight I'm really removing myself from the environment with just my mind or my body and then when you're up at freezer faint you essentially have the active in and Cycle Stop functioning or just fall off um so this some yeah let's do one more exercise and then then I'll bring it in closing so that's the theory let's see if we can try and invoke a bit of the feeling so for a moment just reflect on you alone in the cosmos versus you belonging within the universe and so if you just felt that shift that was um you moving up and down within the poly Bagel Theory you just experienced what that was in your body and so for me one of the areas I really found it helpful to apply this um and I should mention as I've started to grow in this body work I'm also taking a coaching class so I'm studying how to disseminate some of this and actually practicing disseminating it so I guess I can also say what I see resonate with some of my coaches as well as myself is um that just acknowledging that this is part of our wiring as humans the vast majority of us and we have it's almost like an airplane model where we just have redundant system after redundant redundant system for connection as we engage in those we help move ourselves down to more calm grounded creative States um in what we're doing and taking the time to intentionally feed that intentionally build communities around us enable us in our intentions and I think it's also really important to notice here note here that society and culture has made it very easy for us to be separated from others so if we are feeling lonely it's important to acknowledge that there's a stigma around that that is often unfair and inaccurate um and is rather the need for us to be more intentional about it in a society and culture that doesn't always Foster it so I would say nothing's wrong with you if you're feeling lonely and it's about finding ways to be intentional of making more connection okay so we can talk a little bit about environment um uh actually let's talk about mutualism and connection with others okay so we can also think about in this group I'll use the word Markov blanket um putting around not only ourselves but our significant our partners um our communities we could even extend that to include our pets or the parks around us um and what does that look like and that's where I think um it continues to get really beautiful active inference how it encourages mutualism um symbiotic relationships that are beneficial for for all and you can see this for examples existing already right International Aid is a beautiful system where we're all supporting one another right if something catastrophic hits one area you can see the rest of humanity U mobilized to help enable that area other areas you can see this play out really beautifully um is in PC gaming uh where mutualistic Behavior allows you to be more Innovative complete more complex um initiatives together and you can also see what happens to people who don't participate in that way um and how the community responds to that um yeah it's also interesting to put a lens on this about what does it mean for future Generations so you can take it Beyond this time and place including you know how much would we love the idea of mutualism if we were no longer at the top um yeah so I'll go ahead and pull a few more ideas in before moving towards closing um and again do feel free to follow up with questions essentially active inference tells us how to hold enables us to hold uncertainty and that's a large part of what Society is feeling right now like there's this Collective angst because we are going through Rapid change and so if we are able to enable our active inference Cycles more we'll be able to navigate this rapid change more whether that's um in integrating Ai and Society uh handling things like climate change um those sort of spaces and so but we have these systems that are wired to protect us and keep us safe so we also need to be um intentional about how we feed and enable or active INF cycle so for example my time on social media like not only am I careful not to spend too much time there where we know fear can spread like a contagion among a number of other things that can happen uh it also enables me to connect with others and see be uh you know cute photos of cats and dogs but I'm intentional on how I feed my social media feed right what am I liking what am I putting into it and what am I not and I've uh for example have a Reddit feed that's full of uplifting content uh so I do enjoy going to it um and then on in stagram I tend to keep it shorter and really check in with friends and family and then um often choose to to step away so I find a way where I feel like I'm taking the best from social media for me but also making sure that I'm not feeding that fear cycle overfeeding it um and then I also think about music and how that affects my active inference cycle if we know that a lot of what's happening in our Consciousness in our active inference cycle is sub conscious I think about that in music so often if I want to listen to something a beat I listen to it in a language that I don't understand so I don't actually have to worry if those words are necessarily uplifting in my active imprint cycle um or not uh and I actually do subtly feel a difference in my body uh gratitude practice is another area with a lot of research um behind it just pulling moments throughout the day or even a little gratitude um journal in the evening again thinking about okay well how can I be aware of the actual state of the world but also stay balanced and grounded and calm like what what how can I feed my active inference cycle to enable it to be that way um going and doing things that in invoke things like awe wonder and curiosity um is another really great space ah now and also it's interesting to think about okay what are we holding within us that we haven't had a chance to process through our active inference cycle um part of that for me was realizing that I wanted to work through steps of forgiveness um and it's interesting to Define forgiveness I I didn't take a chance to do it here but it doesn't necessarily mean you need to welcome that in back into your space instead it's about acknowledging what happened acknowledging maybe how you you played in that how you contribute to it how you were involved in that and then letting it go so essentially moving it through your system and then obviously certain religious practices put other things on top of that I want to welcome that um but I'm just going to share like the very U foundational sort of um definition here yeah it's really interesting to think about communication and active inference like think about how brilliant are active cycle is within each of us and now when we try and engage with each other how small of a fiber how small a bandwidth communication is and that's why taking the time to study or read up on some communication books and think about okay how can I communicate effectively can be so valuable because we really do have limited bandwidth there and taking the time to sharpen those skills really can help enable us in our connection with others and then another idea I'm playing around with I call it bandwidth right now I don't think that's going to be the word in the end I think it's more like cultivating but essentially we want to make our active inference cycle as effective as possible and so the word I have right now is bandwidth um but I think I think I'll end up playing with that things that shrink that are things like blaming controlling trying to change others aversion grasping these are are all Limited in their effectiveness and require high levels of energy each of those can be broken down as to what systems they're turning on and where that energy is getting blocked I won't do that here but I will say again Berne Brown's work can be really great in the space things like blame if I'm blaming someone that's usually a signal to me that I need to move into another space and I can feel it in my body in my energy level as I do that if I as I move towards things like acceptance self-compassion non-judgment awareness mindfulness enabling boundaries are all enabling the cycle more although sometimes it does mean a short-term increased discomfort so for example if I need to set a boundary with somebody it might be hard for me to do that it might be hard to acknowledge that it might be a difficult conversation with the person but then after I've put that in FA in place and I've done that with compassion and empathy I'll then have more space to run my active inference cycle effectively so sometimes there is initial discomfort but then the payoff is afterwards um yeah and you know this is um I'm going to see how big of a bridge I can build right now because I I realize I am pulling from active infer and I'm applying it very right brain uh but I would like to pull to this idea of um inner goodness and still playing around with the words there but if we think about the neurobiology of empathy Oxycontin and how it creates bonding and social interactions stress responses and social support the pleasure in giving in our biological reward systems we have systems and processes we already saw an active INF and how that encourages mutualism and also physiological processes that enable inner goodness within us and if I wasn't like if if I really go right brain I'll say that I draw Hope from that that as we enable our active inference Cycles we enable this physiology within us more and more um yeah so remembering that I have these systems of inner goodness within me and everyone else does but that there's a lot of stuff interfering with our active inference cycle right now but we have this beautiful science of active inference cycle that can help us clean it up gives me a lot of compassion empathy and hope both for myself and others Okay so I actually have one more section I think um we should include um and this is really stretching the bridge uh but I I don't think we are if you actually get down into the definitions of it um spirituality and the definition the bridge definition of spirituality from the Webster dictionary is attention on the human Spirit or Soul beyond the material or the physical so I want to make it very clear that um you can be an atheist uh you can follow a formalized religion agnostic most anything within that space um and still reflect on the space of spirituality um because in the end we are humans and we get to have the experience of being human and there's something magical about sitting in that experience and reflecting on it um um for those who do practice more formalized religions it's interesting to think about how you can pull in active inference cycle into um that particular um religion that you might be practicing I only have a few examples here to to throw up but just to to give you a chance to think about it um what is important from the science perspective the active inference perspective as we think about mutualism is two things the two sort of boundaries that we put around the space of of spirituality and religion one is um we have a harder time when it creates disbelief of robust science and when doat dogmatic beliefs create increased conflict so if we were to put two boundaries this is a great practice of boundaries we like we welcome you we want you in this space and we were to put two boundaries around it those are the two that that we would start to put in place um and I don't have the specific citations handy they're in my footnotes here but um if you'd like them I can I can share them okay so in closing I'd like to leave you with some personal thoughts and Reflections um in hopes of inspiring your own um yeah so I went through a lot of really big changes I I used to be in the Bay Area working in big Tech I am now in Portugal working on this personal passion projects um I had a number of health things happen at the same time and I would say also my for lack of better words way of being within the world has shifted um and I would say my active inference cycle is much more enabled but also enabled that I would say ultimately I am living a life that I find much more fulfilling enables me to enable others more um and that I'm much I don't want to say happier within but I would say there is more joy and more experiences of Joy uh and essentially the really key piece uh was active inference and applying it to the larger space of Wellness science but also learning how to experience it within me right if we're going to pull from both the right and the left side of the brain it's not all the chalkboard half of it is the experience of living it um and ultimately and it's kind of almost like a a doctor breaking the bad news like it wasn't the science doesn't tell me that it's a single hack and I don't think everyone's changes needs to be as Extreme as my own um I think that was related to my personal set of circumstances but it's more of a lifestyle it's more of a larger intention than I'm just going to do this one single thing but it's also all about baby steps so I suppose since we know were so good with intentions I would invite you to take a moment to think about okay what's one or two or three things maybe one for the mind one for the body one for the environment that resonated for me in this talk and what are my intentions that I'm going to do with it to enable my own personal active inference so I'll just give you a moment to reflect on that um for the mind it could have been something around mindfulness or medit ation um could maybe be thinking about working through a forgiveness exercise um journaling it could be reflecting on this model more uh for the body it could be maybe your intentions around it um some way you're going to act enact to enable your environment more um okay and then I guess in closing um I'll just share a little bit about what I'm hoping to do with this work uh if I think about the hierarchy of intentions um you know on the bottom level I think it's worth noting that I am exploring how to do this work outside the typical academic model uh because I think it means I can focus more time on it um because now ai can inti help contribute that so there is a question of you know how am I going to monetize this in a modest way to enable myself and those around me but I'm not looking to similar to follow following Carl fren's sort of um initiative not looking to uh patent everything and and LLC everything uh but find a balance there and do it in a mutualism way if I think about the middle um you know with this work I'm hoping to create Community around it enable community around it um and help others derive belonging as substance from it and then if I think about the top um it's fulfilling work for me I love doing it and I hope to continue doing it and I hope this work I can use it to help others also find more fulfilling lives um so I want to be really transparent in my intentions with this because I am very open to collaborations I'm currently exploring a social media campaign so we can start to see what resonates like how do we meet people where they're at and what resonates with them start to get some information on that and then I've also enlisted um a really great New York Times best-selling Ghost Writer um and thinking about how do we package this in infographics and highly distilled principles that are absorbable to a large number of people so uh we're trying to follow a model uh if you remember from the early thousands or late 90s don't sweat the small stuff you know know something very small easy to pick up at a bookstore um and then yeah I'll be transparent with this group this is probably a really amazing um research project for AI and you know how do you develop a tool there um I'm excited by that idea but it's also perhaps um out of my grasp at the moment that's a that's a pretty big project so yeah thanks thanks for taking the time um creating the space and uh I hope you found some some helpful information for you and it inspired you in some way thank you wow many ways to go I wrote down many things um I will read first a question from the live chat and we'll just get right into it um all right let's do okay okay yinyang Bal wrote talking about the mind brain and body are you aware of the second brain guts and the Brain gut axis this concept would affect how you define the boundary between the mind and the body um So my answer to that would be yes and no I think if you I don't remember the the author of the book at the moment but to the point um that barrier between the mind and the body is with a dash line intentionally because there are many systems that overlap and you could expand it and contract it to like the definition is not black and white so I would say from what I'm understanding of that theory it would make a lot of sense to me we get signals from various parts in the body and often we categorize stuff in the mind that actually is living in the brain um so yes it probably does encompass components of that the um and I do hope that in the book and as we develop this concept we pull out the intricate systems that run between the body and the mind more in an easy to distill way um we just we haven't had a chance to do it so clearly here the dash line is a great touch often the idea of an interface or boundary or marov blanket is seen as isolating but it's actually the coupling entity the piece that connects the inner and the outer connecting the internal States and the external states it is their coupling so that's like kind of literally the two sides of the coin and that's why the dash Line's a nice graphical Motif because it is permeable it isn't like an isolating boundary it's actually like the interface that Maps between those two very different worlds yeah um there's so many places to um jump in I guess maybe with intention was one thing I kind of wrote down and connecting to the idea in active inference that the actions that are taken whether they're like external actions going on a walk or whether it's an internal action like attention and choice internally the actions are selected based upon them being likely not based upon them being rewarding so in the kind of cultural milu of reward and maximization optimization and reward learning computationally there's this idea like there's some scale and then we should select different actions based upon like how high they score on that reward scale whether it's like a job or personal life when we have this concept that our actions are selected based upon them being likely or just consistent or confirmatory then there's a direct route from the intention to taking the action because the intention kind of sets the stage for something to be likely and that covers positive intentions it also kind of covers where attentions go arai because a a malicious intention is also still fulfilled even when it doesn't have anything rewarding about it yeah yeah um and that's what makes me so excited about collaborating in this space right like you have this inner depth of knowledge and active inference and you're so quickly able to see how the formulas and it all comes together and it's it's really interesting because on one hand you have that and another it's really interesting to pull in from Buddhist traditions because you have people who without the formulas have been thinking about how effectively do I do how do I do this effectively and you actually see them come over together in so many ways and like I just saw an example of that in in what you were saying interesting like another little kind of like history trail that connects to that is Carl friston's earlier work was in neuroimaging and so that's kind of like the view from the outside it's known what the person in the fmri machine is thinking but you you do have access to like their blood flow and so there's a lot of the mathematics developed about that view from the outside and then more recently there have been so many creative contributions from people from different like meditation and contemplation practices focused on the view from the inside and that is like it's approaching the dashed line from both sides and they're meeting in the middle because the formalism could help like a behavioral researcher talk about an ant on the ground from the outside and then also it's like in some ways more powerful or differently powerful like directly Us in the driver's seat and so that was one thing that that really I think stays with me from your presentation and um complement a lot of the other work is like a lot of the other work is us on the side looking at that car drive by but we're in our own bodies and so that's a very different kind of Engagement even if the situation of a car driving down the road is the same it really matters if you're on the sideline versus if you're in the car yeah yeah yeah these are beautiful examples another really fun one I was having um speaking of neuroimaging and and this sort of space exploring yesterday is this idea of Harmony right you feel Harmony but to neuroimaging it's a great question of like well what's happening within the body and the name of the specific networks that were lightning lighting up and when it was in um expected patterns versus unexpected patterns um and then also how the music itself is built on patterns so you start to again really see that right brain like oh I can feel Harmony I sense Harmony but there's also this left brain of oh there's mathematical patterns that are happening within the music different cultures build different patterns within that music and oh by the way my brain is lighting up in different ways depending on what's expected and if it's Out Of Tune or in tune it's just really beautiful how it all comes together yes the left brain right brain it's like and the integration half a brain is less than half a brain it's nonfunctional um and it just made me think about the active inference Learning Journey and about how the kinds of activities on that path you you listed many like just making poetry or making a drawing and those are not detours in our holistic understanding but a lot of science or technical education has kind of implicitly or explicitly framed the artistic or the aesthetic or the personal as like a detour or like even a no-o Zone basically whereas especially in a time when we have computational intelligences that are PhD level Plus+ Plus on the technical details so then having the intention and the awareness and an aesthetic can get someone further in just like a few prompts than like studying till the end of time and even like coming from research you can study numbers your whole life and you still would have only explored a little bit of numbers there's a time to just like put it down and play with it and I think with all of the scientific threads you brought brought together it's kind of like we have enough threads to make this web of associations into something that people can actually use for their own local positive ends yes and that is not just like a research rabbit hole it's not like you just go to the researcher who came up with vagel and dive down down down down down I mean where does that reductionist Journey take you like okay to the membrane of a neuron firing or not based upon permeability it's like is that what's at the end of the road or is there another route that instead of just escaping and hiding down the rabbit hole it kind of stays out in the social and in the communicative space and is used for ends yeah yeah yeah those are all really great points and then to build on it it brings up questions like how do you share developing science with in Mass while continuing trust but also enabling space that this is a building space like this is still developing and so then it's questions of like you know how do you deliver deliver that message in a way that's absorbable so like one question is well instead of just throwing it over the fence can we create a feedback loop right is the content we deliver have a survey option where people can say what's working with them for what's not what's resonating so we people don't feel like we're just throwing it at them another is to be like you know your active infer cycle what works for you like what is resonating with you like pick that up focus on that like we are different self-actualization the further you get up the pyramid the more individualized the needs are so encouraging people to take what's for them so there's like yeah there's a lot of really interesting questions um around this space but you pointed out a really great one and that's like when is science ready to take to people and help them and this space definitely seems like it's reached that it's just a question of how yes and how to include and communicate in the science I think a few pieces of active inference that help a lot first as you pointed out at the very beginning is you said activ inference enables us to hold uncertainty it gives us like a handle or a buffer we're talking about uncertainties literally designing systems even really simple ones like a pendulum but we could still approach that and talk about uncertainty and hold up like the mean and the variance together instead of only trying to distill down to one so there's that kind of like Unity is plural at minimum to and then statistically kind of breaks down into like mean invariance and then also the action perception loop it's like undeniable and even if somebody's listening and they're bored or they're agitated or Whatever It Is by whatever the material is that experience they're having is its Prima fascia evidence that they are in that action perception Loop whereas something that's happening like at a molecular level or at a cosmological level there may have to be some like abstractions required to really understand okay well this is like why when this light turns that color that reflects this very large or very small event occurring and that may be a totally rigorous chain of causation and yet it still is very removed from our direct experience but like whether the person is looking at the microscope or the telescope or just the naked eye it's their sight that they can actually have this inner experience around and so that's kind of a unique doorway that's very fun to explore yeah yeah okay I'll read another comment from Mick ther in the chat who wrote hi Anna lovely talk fascinating I'd love to chat how this would be beneficial to the community of people living with persistent pain and maybe able to help with AI developments yes I would love to have that conversation as someone who just came out of a health cycle with a lot of chronic pain was a very lived experience for me um and quite frankly impacted this work because I had such sensitivity like I had really small bandwidth for holding discomfort um because of the physical discomfort I was in um yes so I wouldn't say I'm ready to speak to it um at a larger level but I would say I think there's a lot in the space and I I would love to do a little bit of digging so yeah and then we can always post whatever we come up with cool um I was thinking about the the wheel of emotions and then how you emphasize that like we move through them kind of like we have there's like a ticker or a point in the wheels kind of rotating or moving or changing and and then about how even when like walking is painful that is its own message and there's so many ways that can go like into the physical therapy or accessibility or the performance angle but again across that whole Continuum those are all people taking steps or trying to and so pulling back to that level of abstraction has that that Paradox to hold of being like seemingly lifted or different than our experience and yet the more we think about it it just comes to in mesh with our experience and it's just a question of what we attend to I mean one could attend to every single step and like muscle fiber contraction in a movement yeah and that would essentially be a mindfulness practice Yeah approach that from another way yeah so yes so I guess I'll be brave and put my toe in the water so I've been exploring this and and I don't feel like it's fully developed yet but one of the things that really res two two key ideas that really resonate with me one is if we pull from people who've been thinking about this from an experiential point of view for Generations from Buddhist philosophies um you would see an acknowledging but not overg grabbing so pulling it into the active inference cycle without over empath emphasizing on it so perhaps making the feelings of pain louder than they are and it's really interesting because I started digging into this from the idea of um what is beauty and what is Harmony and the systems in the body that respond to Harmony and dissonance or beauty and ugliness they are systems within our anatomy that don't contain a switch so I can't say I only want to experience beauty without those systems also handling um ugliness there's no way for me to impose that filter as a human being so that's where I start to see the physiology of a human start to align with some of these Eastern philosophies and people who've been thinking about this for Generations um but I don't think that the idea is fully developed yet but but I think I think it'll it'll include both of those yes like experiences are not simply good like I talk a lot with my wife about Salt Fat acid heat we like the cookbook and just the idea and it's like but everything contains heat I mean molecular motion everything contains protons acidity so it's like they're all contina and then in one moment you might want something salty but another moment not so nothing more necessarily needs to be filled in than like the framework and then the cookbook and then it's left to the household on that night what to make because to to try to brick and mortar more in would reduce the degrees of freedom in maybe someone's on a low salt diet or someone wants more salt or something like that like you can't know so when you have the the pillars of the tenants or the kind of distillable principles and then the recipe book with a lot of motifs like here are some bodily positions here are some Progressive um sequences or whatever it happens to be it's like that's that's where we jump off in our actual engagements there's no more in principle necessarily to resolve and for something like bodily activity or cooking it kind of is clearer what the ends are of that work but then in like computational Neuroscience or in the math mathematics of Consciousness it kind of like takes off and it just keeps going and yet it also can return back yeah and okay I'll just read one comment um of the positive comments in the chat um yinyang balance wrote good ideas on the differ differentiation nature of our mind to experience the environment therefore we have to experence ER both sides of the yin and yangang beauty and ugly oh thank you um well do you have any questions or thoughts or I mean where where do you go or I guess um just a moment of GRA gratitude right for this community for being welcomed here being able to share the thoughts um yeah it on a lot of levels um I'm very grateful for it and um yeah the the invitation to collaborate um if I can get help something you're working on like touch happy to go both ways and um yeah thank you so much for having me here Daniel it was awesome and again I think it really compliments a lot of the work in the material so I hope that people enjoy it and looking forward to 76.2 wonderful thanks okay thank you thank you for
