- The goal is to create generally intelligent AI without harming humanity.
- Active inference is a framework for agents to minimize free energy.
- Learning will be essential for agents to navigate complex environments.
- Agents will be trained in environments promoting cooperation and competition.
- The environment needs to provide continuous learning opportunities for agents.
- Agents will develop communication skills as they learn to cooperate.
- The project aims to create agents capable of love and caring.
- The environment will adapt to the agents' increasing intelligence.
- The research will explore how to quantify agents' intelligence.
- Agents will learn to avoid local optima through cooperation.
- The approach will leverage kinship to promote cooperative behaviors.
- Collaboration is sought for further development and testing of agents.
