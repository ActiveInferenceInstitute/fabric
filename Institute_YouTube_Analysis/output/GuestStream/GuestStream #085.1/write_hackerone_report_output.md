**Title:** Complex Multi-Agent Learning Environment Using Active Inference Principles

## Summary:
This project leverages active inference and reinforcement learning to create a multi-agent environment where agents learn through competition and cooperation. The aim is to develop generally intelligent agents capable of adapting to new environments and displaying complex social behaviors.

## Description:
The proposed system integrates active inference with reinforcement learning principles, allowing agents to interact with a dynamic environment that adapts based on their actions. Each agent is designed to navigate a competitive landscape, where they must gather resources, manage energy, and make strategic decisions to maximize rewards. The reward structure is designed to promote both individual achievement and cooperative behavior among agents, simulating a kinship-based social dynamic. 

Agents are parameterized using neural networks, which serve as universal function approximators capable of learning complex behaviors. The environment is constructed to encourage continuous learning, with varying resource availability and agent interactions that lead to emergent behaviors. This setup aims to explore the balance between competition and cooperation, fostering a diverse set of behaviors that can be studied and analyzed.

The challenges identified include the computational intractability of traditional Bayesian inference, which the active inference model seeks to approximate. By allowing agents to learn their generative models through experience rather than predefined structures, the project aims to push the boundaries of what intelligent agents can achieve in simulated environments.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Clone the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/daveta/meta`.
2. Follow the instructions in the README to set up the environment and dependencies.
3. Run the simulation scripts provided in the repository to observe agent behavior in the training environment.

## Impact:
This research has significant implications for the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) by demonstrating how agents can learn complex behaviors in a dynamic environment. The ability to foster cooperation and competition among agents reflects social dynamics observed in nature, which may lead to the emergence of more sophisticated and adaptable AI systems. The insights gained could influence future AI architectures and training methodologies, promoting the creation of agents that are not only intelligent but also socially aware and capable of collaborative behaviors.
