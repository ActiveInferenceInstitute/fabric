QUESTIONS
- Gareth, thank you very much for joining. Looking forward to your presentation and the discussion we’ll have. Thank you so much for having me, Daniel, and it’s an absolute pleasure to be on the stream. One that I’ve watched many times, and it’s privileged to be able to talk through the paper. I’m hoping to give you a little bit of background as to why I wrote the paper, where I’ve come from, a little bit of history, talk through the paper itself, and then hopefully take some interesting questions. If there’s anybody watching or from Daniel himself who’s always got some very insightful questions to ask. So if you’re all right, Daniel, am I okay to start and get going?
- Did that make sense?
- Have you got any questions so far, or do you want me to just work through the paper quickly?
- Is that okay?
- So how does an officer’s body generate these hunches, these internal alarm bells, and what role do they play in navigating the experience of being a police officer?
- Can you answer my questions?
- So how are police trained to avoid groupthink, i.e., not just follow the ones with improper force over motivations?
- How do hunches align with hallucinations in deep learning?
- What overlap exists with military psychology?
