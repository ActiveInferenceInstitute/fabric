  "description": "\"The Police Hunch: The Bayesian Brain, Active Inference, and the Free Energy Principle in Action\"\nGareth Lee Stubbs\nhttps://ra.ac.ae/en/faculty/bio/dr-gareth-lee-stubbs\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1368265/full\nGareth Lee Stubbs & Karl Friston\n\nIn the realm of law enforcement, the \u201cpolice hunch\u201d has long been a mysterious but crucial aspect of decision-making. Drawing on the developing framework of Active Inference from cognitive science, this theoretical article examines the genesis, mechanics, and implications of the police hunch. It argues that hunches \u2013 often vital in high-stakes situations \u2013 should not be described as mere intuitions, but as intricate products of our mind\u2019s generative models. These models, shaped by observations of the social world and assimilated and enacted through active inference, seek to reduce surprise and make hunches an indispensable tool for officers, in exactly the same way that hypotheses are indispensable for scientists. However, the predictive validity of hunches is influenced by a range of factors, including experience and bias, thus warranting critical examination of their reliability. This article not only explores the formation of police hunches but also provides practical insights for officers and researchers on how to harness the power of active inference to fully understand policing decisions and subsequently explore new avenues for future research.\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
