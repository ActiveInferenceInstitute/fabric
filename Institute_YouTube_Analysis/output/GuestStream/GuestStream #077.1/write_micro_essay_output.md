Active inference is a fascinating concept, particularly when applied to the realm of decision-making in policing. Gareth Stubs’ exploration of the "police hunch" sheds light on how officers navigate complex, high-pressure situations. Having spent 18 years as a police officer, Gareth draws from real-life experiences to illustrate how hunches, often seen as inexplicable, are deeply rooted in a police officer’s training and past encounters.

The crux of Gareth's argument is that hunches are not mere gut feelings; they are informed by a wealth of accumulated experiences, which he refers to as "Baysian building blocks." This framework allows officers to make rapid decisions in unpredictable environments where rational deliberation is often impractical. He emphasizes that the decision-making process in policing is influenced by both the immediate circumstances and the officer's historical context.

Gareth’s insights about the emotional and physiological responses to situations are particularly compelling. The difference in how officers react—sometimes instinctively—can lead to significantly different outcomes. For example, an officer might experience a visceral reaction to a domestic violence call that prompts immediate action, while a colleague might not feel the same urgency. This highlights the need for further research into how hunches develop and how they can be effectively communicated and utilized within police training.

Overall, understanding the interplay between intuition and decision-making in policing can lead to better training and potentially improved outcomes in law enforcement.
