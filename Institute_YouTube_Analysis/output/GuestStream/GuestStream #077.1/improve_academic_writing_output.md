**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome to everyone. This is Active Inference Guest Stream 77.1. We are joined by Gareth Stubs, who will discuss the concept of the police hunch. Gareth, thank you for joining us. I look forward to your presentation and the ensuing discussion.

Thank you very much for having me, Daniel. It is an absolute pleasure to be on this stream, one that I have watched many times. It is a privilege to discuss my paper with you. I aim to provide some background on why I wrote the paper, my personal history, a thorough examination of the paper itself, and I hope to engage with some intriguing questions from the audience or from you, Daniel, who always poses insightful inquiries.

If it is alright with you, Daniel, I will begin.

To provide some context, I am a relatively new academic. I served as a police officer in the UK for 18 years, primarily in a Northern English force. Throughout my career, I engaged in a variety of roles, from frontline emergency response to community policing, which involved building relationships within the community and gathering intelligence. I also worked on long-term problem-solving initiatives and contributed to national strategy efforts. My experience includes a position at the College of Policing and, more recently, at the Home Office’s inspectorate, where we inspected police officers to ensure adherence to established policing standards and their documentation.

During the last five years of my policing career, I pursued a part-time PhD. Although one might expect my research to focus on police decision-making, it actually revolved around two theories: representative bureaucracy and social embeddedness. Specifically, my research examined how new police recruits navigate the recruitment process using their social networks. This investigation sought to uncover the reasons behind the discriminatory nature of our recruitment processes.

I have been working on publishing findings from my PhD over the last two to three years. Following that, I had the opportunity to teach police officers in the Middle East. Two individuals I wish to acknowledge during this stream are Professor Karl Friston, who was incredibly supportive when I reached out to him, and two well-known criminologists, Ken Pease and Jason Roach. My exploration into this area of study began with a discussion with them regarding the peculiar decision-making processes observed during police service. Officers often make decisions that others find perplexing, yet when they articulate their reasoning, they frequently reference a complex series of past experiences that led to their conclusions.

It was Ken Pease, a renowned criminologist, who advised me to investigate the Bayesian brain, suggesting that my observations aligned with its principles. This recommendation prompted me to delve into foundational papers on the subject, which I found quite complex due to my lack of background in mathematics, neuroscience, or cognitive science. However, he recommended a book titled "Superforecasting" by Philip E. Tetlock, which elucidates the human art of prediction and the role of intuition in the Bayesian brain. I found this book enlightening, as it allowed me to reflect on my own policing experiences and how my decision-making evolved over time.

During my tenure at the Home Office, we observed a general inclination towards promoting generalists within police forces. Many senior managers had diverse experiences across various roles, including detectives, uniformed officers, and corporate positions. This resulted in a prevalence of senior leaders who were often "jack of all trades, master of none," which contradicted existing research advocating for teams of specialists with solid knowledge bases leading to improved decision-making outcomes.

As I engaged with the concept of superforecasting, I began to comprehend the mechanics of the Bayesian brain. If one were to search for "the Bayesian brain" on YouTube, one would inevitably encounter Professor Friston's work, which significantly influenced my understanding. Two years ago, I immersed myself in his podcasts as well as discussions from Machine Learning Street Talk and Kurt J. Mungal's "Theory of Everything" podcast, which presented lengthy dialogues on these subjects. This exploration led me to question why such concepts had not been applied practically within policing. In training sessions, experienced practitioners often discussed their decision-making processes without empirical support for the models employed.

The best research I encountered regarding police decision-making models is found in Andy Clark's book, "The Experience Machine," which dedicates a chapter to this topic. However, I digress. To share a pivotal experience from my service that informed my paper, I was a newly promoted sergeant supervising a team of approximately 15 officers at the age of 27 or 28. One evening, I accompanied a new officer, Jamie, to high-risk incidents to help him build confidence. When a domestic violence call came in, we learned that the male offender was still inside the house, and the female victim was severely injured.

As we approached the front door, I experienced a profound physiological reaction—my heart sank, adrenaline surged, and I felt an intense sense of foreboding, which Jamie did not share. This discrepancy in our reactions highlighted the influence of accumulated experiences on decision-making. After a violent confrontation with the male offender, who was armed with a knife, we managed to ensure the safety of the victim and her child. This incident left a lasting impression on me, particularly the salience of my bodily response compared to Jamie's lack of similar sensations.

This reflection leads me to consider how police officers' decision-making processes differ from traditional work environments. In policing, the unpredictability of situations requires officers to make rapid decisions, often without the opportunity for longitudinal analysis of their actions. I argue that the law serves as a framework within which officers must operate, yet the chaotic nature of their work often necessitates swift, pragmatic responses. The result is a tendency for officers to rely on intuition and hunches, which may not always be rationalized effectively.

In my paper, I propose a definition of a hunch as an often unbidden, salient intuition experienced by a police officer that subsequently influences their actions. This definition acknowledges the role of hunches in shaping decision-making processes, particularly in high-stress situations. I also highlight the need for further research into the cognitive processes that underlie hunch generation and their implications for police practice.

As I conclude, I express my enthusiasm for exploring these themes further and welcome any questions or discussions from the audience.
