  "description": "Narrative Fallacy and Other Limitations of Psychodynamic Case Formulation\nhttps://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/znxs5\nAlexey Tolchinsky\n\nThis paper describes a phenomenon of narrative fallacy in psychodynamic psychotherapy and makes a case that it is likely related to therapists\u2019 working memory limitations. The impact of narrative fallacy on model complexity is examined with a focus on further improving the efficacy of clinical treatment. The specifics of the psychodynamic meaning-making process gravitating toward searching for causal or teleological explanations are reviewed. Tentative perspectives on these processes from the standpoint of active inference and neuropsychology are presented. This paper also examines the issues with verifiability in the psychodynamic hypothesis testing process with a focus on the Barnum/Forer effect. Preliminary proposals are formulated to help mitigate the impact of these issues on clinical practice.\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
