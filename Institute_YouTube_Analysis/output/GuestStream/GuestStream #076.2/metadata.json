  "description": "\"Active Inference Circle Book Project and Things Update\"\nAnna Pereira\n\nThis talk looks to update the active inference for a fulfilling life book project as well foster collaboration and mutualism.  The talk will provide a high level update of the book status, share some updates and experiences of the AII Research Fellows program, share strategy of how I'm using existing ecosystems outside AII to help foster additional growth, and include a conversation on satiated mutualism balanced with the necessity of realistic protective mechanisms.  This talk will include a few slides, but be more conversational in format with a goal of creating transparency, inviting collaboration, and sharing out learnings that might help others in their journeys.  \n\nhttps://fellows.activeinference.institute/\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
