all right hello and welcome this is active inference guest stream 76.2 it's July 18th 2024 we're back with Anna pra and this is going to be an update on the new active inference book for fostering and fulfilling life we'll have some slides and some fun conversation and also look forward to any question people WR in the live chat so thank you and welcome back Anna we would be happy to hear updates see some visuals where things at with the book and project H well thank you so much for having me back Daniel it truly is a pleasure um yeah so I treated today pretty casual as I've had an opportunity to get to know the community more um and essentially set aside some time to create an update that I thought people might find valuable um as I kind of hear about what they're working on um and um provide advice and maybe share some insights from some brainstorming you and I have been doing uh so it's quite casual it sounds like people can send you questions um and then yeah you and I can can play around but I did like a a twoos slide recap just because I think so many people have probably heard of it and we can also send people back um to the previous presentation uh but essentially working on a book uh and what that mission is going to be is to perform a meta analysis of the larger Wellness space through the lens of active inference like uh the moment I discovered active inference it was such an aha moment um using that to highlight the most impactful points for the larger population so that means we're taking this information and making it culturally relevant it's what from this right now is the most impactful uh in an easily digestible format um a lot of people have so many things going on in their life and various skill sets uh there's limited bandwidth to learn there's definitely interest but it's like okay how we can we package this in a way that's absorbable um for a much larger audience and just one of the things that's exciting about this is just how ripe the whole active inference space is and one of my hopes is that by distilling and teaching active inference in this book getting people to believe in it like gravity it actually does the larger community of service um helps um with things like dissemination and growing vocabulary that might be more largely relatable um and it's been a true joy to really brainstorm that with a um a number of people from the community um oh I know I can't mention everyone but but like yourself um have been really great uh Susan JF Carl um and more so I I am really grateful for that and I look forward to to pulling that in more um I'm not going to get too much into the actual strategy of the book today this is just a quick shot screenshot to say um the book is going to look more like this than uh perhaps what you might consider a book or or a textbook to look at I'm really looking to make make it approachable and desirable to grab up and um pulling from several other um uh people in the larger literature space uh that are getting themselves in bookstores and sell selling over a thousand copies and more but it ends up the vast majority of books never even sell more than a thousand so one of our goals again is like as we get this word out you know how to we create it in a way that helps with dissemination um Danel did you have any questions or points on that I think maybe the next section we might have more to chat about but yeah keep going okay um so I keep trying to or I keep studying the language and the principles of this domain um I still rely very heavily on putting dense things into something like chat gbt or another tool um and having it synthesized for me but I think I learned the word beliefs today so you can let me know if I'm using this accurately or not um and I wanted to start the presentation for one that's really sitting deeply with me and resonating with me and that's around this idea of where it's such a marvelous point in time um to be a part of something that is so needed um and so ripe uh for that creation and dissemination and so we get to the thing about how we want to design that but before I get into that I like to think about okay well what did that used to be like for me in the past um and I used to live um in the Bay Area uh in California and for me in my system the ecosystem there felt like um like a luxurious survival we had more than we needed there was this like faster bigger better grow like um and I I want to be careful to call out and say I don't think it's that way for everyone um but I think it's possible for many who are within that ecosystem and so as I think about okay well what am I hoping to grow here and like what's one of the key tenants of that um I keep coming back to this phrase of satiated neutralism um and it was really interesting to me as I was reading some of the work around uh beliefs and how that influences our active inference Cycles this morning but it's like well no wonder this is resonating with me so deeply um and even though um I know there's people like um Susan who have really wonderful skill sets in um using words around active inference and negotiation to to put this into more um formulas and principles and um I'm not there yet it's really cool to see how our active inference Cycles naturally run and kind of like create that um even without necessarily having absorbed all those principles yet um so I thought that that was just another beautiful example this morning but I bring this up because it relates to the active inference Institute um in a number of ways and I think Daniel one of the ones I wanted to highlight was just how amazing of an opportunity being um a research fellow at The Institute has been right you put in so much work to build out that infrastructure and create this initial program for three people and I know a number of our intents are like okay well how do we grow this for more to come after us um and so like even that in itself it's been really cool to see how that has moved this forward and then already prompted discussions about okay well like how do we build this ecosystem right like how do we share those intents and like our vocabulary is different but I feel like the the beliefs hold a lot of similarities thank you yeah I'd be curious where did you get to with the belief learning and how did that land and how do you see that connecting with active inference um so I haven't drafted it for the Ghost Rider yet but um what we try and do is we try and take the points that we think are going to be most helpful for people and then we run it through a model of where we share it with the people with people in the book and each time that happens we pull in active inference and how it influences active inference the way I'm currently thinking about illustrating it is um we all have and and this will be done with the help of a designer I don't have those yet um but let's let's use my fist as um every human's capacity um or you could also put um the law of conservation conservation of energy around it um and so we all have finite capacity finite resources and uh we all want to do a lot with it right and and it's up to our individual capacity how much we're able to do that and it was really beautiful to me today to realize that um yeah with the help of this larger Community actually how much just us deciding to believe in the strengths and the Beauties and the capacity of this takes us from here to here like we grow just in capacity just by creating those models within ourselves of noting our strengths and noting our capacities and putting those positive yet accurate um reinforcing mental models in place and like that's all you have to do like you get this just by doing that and it's it's really beautiful because instead so many of us are pulling on cultural and societal um models of like um self-deprecation or um pushing ourselves even harder not listening instead when in reality the the growth and and you can see it in the active Incycle and Daniel you probably have the vocab to to pull that out even more eloquently than than me right now but you can just see how it pulls into the whole cycle and sets it up to be more efficacious thanks yeah a few few connections one of them is the idea of action as a fulfilled prediction like what would happen if I look there it's likely that I look there that is what sets the stage I'm the kind of thing that that looks there that's what sets the stage for the icade so there's like that not always conscious element of actions consequences being predicted in real time and then those that align with bounding surprise being selected and then another kind of interesting Trend that I think we'll see come up many many times but belief is like the the um the Superstar of this trend along with memory attention surprise is that many terms from psychology so describing like our experience or other mental or cognitive phenomena those terms were applied to statistics like surprise oh it's a surprise birthday party but then also surprise has a meaning in information Theory and now with Statistics applied to psychology those terms are like reconnecting so now we're talking about belief distributions but aasian belief distribution it doesn't have to refer to like a felt experienced sentiment that a human holds like their favorite food a belief could be like the belief of the metronome about what angle it's at so it doesn't need to imply a psychology but then that's part of this fun REM meting ground where there's the psychological or the personal and it's reconnecting with this kind of Technical and statistical yeah uh super great summary and I already know I'm earmarking it to come back and pull out a statement or two for the book so thanks um so it's been really interesting to build something while thinking about it from a satiated mutualist point of view and when it is that very for me right now in this moment in this example tangible example and felt sense um and so that means for me like yes perhaps the largest um North Star for this book is um impact making positive impact at skill but like right below it like a fraction below it is like okay well how do we use this to build this collaboration and community and satiated mutualism together um and it's such a beautiful place to do that because um so many projects when they're being built what's great is and I I touch on this later is that the the project is being built on my my own personal savings which means that for a very rare instance we can make the purpose of it whatever we want we don't have to worry about shareholders or investors or anything like that we actually get to say our number one goal is positive impact and the next one is to build community and so it's like it's a really beautiful time to get to do that um yeah so I wanted to share that part of it and then I'm thinking about okay well but like this is a real Force like how like how do we actually build this into the book um and so more than creating Community which I'm already very grateful to feel coming together like I live outside lein and so just having the connection um with a group of people who like to think in this way has really meant a lot but like additional ways to call to enable call outs for others that I'm looking at are like call out boxes in the book bios and links to individual work um credited content co- development and really other ideas I'm I don't even feel especially protective about the cover of the book it's more about what's going to like sell the S Help disseminate the book most effectively um so that's a little bit of a pitch there because if you're feeling like this and maybe the other talk are resonating with you um there are options um but it's also interesting and Daniel thank you for brainstorming with me on this there's this question of okay well the project really is like The Sibling right now um I left my career almost three years ago so that means I'm almost at the three-year Mark of no revenue and like it's meant a very adjusted um lifestyle but with so much beautiful potential uh but it also means that this project really it doesn't have a root structure to sustain it yet coming into it so there's this question of like okay well how do we invite in the community and how do we share but how do we remember you know while the vast majority of us aren't bad actors we have to think about how do we protect this little fledgling um and thinking through that and actually putting that into place especially when I haven't had an opportunity to witness it happening so many times is um is a bit challenging so you know like today the this presentation doesn't include a detailed outline of the book because that's essentially a b business plan um that's taken to years worth of time and investment to build and it's just something that can't go out into just um just completely be released just yet so one of the ways where I've been thinking about it is really inviting individual conversations right like if you want to come in or if you think this is going to help you like my goal is to say yes but it's also to acknowledge like we have to be a bit protective um and I just thought it was interesting because I know some of us are thinking about negotiation and mutualism um that that was one of the realizations uh but still really going out of the way to be like okay well but how do we invite it in with a certain level of security and confidence um because ultimately this is where we want to go get to right a much more robust wellestablished root system um where we don't have to be nearly as as protective and um as I think about that aspir aspiration um Daniel I know you and I have started to brainstorm this a bit I'm already we're already starting to have a conversation about like how do we grow this Loop here and you know me coming to you with possible brainstorms and ideas and the new like it feels almost like an iteration um and it's cool to to see it develop not only for this project but for the projects that are going to come next um because it really is a beautiful gift of infrastructure that you're building IU well thank you yeah there's a lot to say I in the the the forest and in open source how these different resources like kind of mobilizable resources like developer talent but also resources of beginners like their curiosity their attention their their interest and ultimately the long pathway that um is there sometimes with some brushes to clear but the pathway that somebody can develop into like having a scientific career and that was the case for entomology it's the case for Python Programming and in the coming soon times it'll also be the case for active inference and so figuring out those trails and modes and having available resources it's great that we can make these Niche modifications like a video that somebody somebody can yell all they want at the video and we'll never hear about it but then when we're talking about our trust and about how we engage in collaborations in open source um we each have seen that from our own background sounds like again like working in science and I've seen people put in work and then not be credited in a paper all these other kinds of things like those kinds of patterns and more and how how do we balance that fine line so that that every seedling can be be in the right place and and grow just to that that first piece and then also on this um cycle it's it's been awesome for us too and it's a team project at The Institute and it's also hopefully prototypical of how a project can can be what it is and how we can be who we are and that can that is the cycle it's not necessarily um emerge anymore than the the liver and the kidney do emerge but it's about figuring out what are the ways and the the information sharing the message passing belief sharing and then the resources and all the different flows that that can co- stabilize and and be aligned with with how we want to see it yes yeah M on um yeah so we're continuing to explore this um don't feel quite ready to release the to go into I think the details because we're still working it out but um I'm also looking at you know how do we develop this ecosystem together and what does that look like for the future from like a monetary point of view and can I make let's say in this for this particular project um like a public commitment to feeding that in um and I think I think we'll be ready to talk about that more at a later date but Daniel if you had any questions or anything you wanted to add yeah well there's a lot of uh exciting directions on the on Institute side yes we'll share more I'm I'm thinking and and wondering as as the ecosystem grows like what kinds of What kinds of niches will people be able to find support in especially as the low bar and the automatable work is already on certain dimensions posthuman in terms of like explaining and rewriting certain things and so there's a lot of functionalities that this field is coming to even its infancy in a already kind of industrialized information setting so that's super different because there are just different niches and also I think that leads to a lot of uncertainty and scarcity ins supportable niches and especially if we think open source and Beyond code developments and Beyond some of the the technical core work that is really critical and so H how will we build and pry openen and welcome into all these like other ways that people might be contributing to Future ecosystems yes to all of that except I absolutely agree with the the certainty I do think it's very interesting that the tools that are being created are creating more opportunities in the cre Creator space so that's actually one of the reasons why you see this project growing the way it is it's strategically developed to stand on top of the tools that are being created but then come in with what the tools can't do and I think I think there's a lot of opportunity to ask ourselves what can be built on top of the tools that are coming to fruition and like where do we add that value and then I love the Poetry the poetic of that AC of inference in itself gives us the capacity to hold more uncertainty which you absolutely do need um so yeah that's the only other that's the only one I would sort of kind of like um push on just a little bit because I feel the fear of it I absolutely do right like you posted the the Google video thing that you tried just yesterday and I was like oh my gosh am I got curve again and it's like no no I'm not I'm not like and we're ready to Pivot we're good I yeah thank you I I really agree with that it's like we're in our active inference flow or cycle and new tools are becoming available that's always been the human story like oh new um Stone tool just dropped new writing instrument just dropped yes the pace and the type of these tools is changing and so that introduces uncertainties that's a discontinuity in the environment and change and then it's like so how do we have a posture and a strategy and tactic so that like we go oh okay well like a new Google video tool I'm sure there's other tools but that was just the one that I tried one prompt makes a short video but then what can I do with that or just the two ways that we can dissipate the free energy change the mind or change the world so it's like if I'm surprised like and I was I see this I I'm surprised by what just happened well part one I can Option One update my beliefs so that I'm not surprised now that I know now that they have a video generation technology I'm not surprised that they have a video generation technology so that dissipates one element of surprise and then what is the actionable relevance maybe I'm not interested in making videos and just move on and just let it go or maybe it's worth exploring some action and so it's like that puts active inference as like a meta technique or meta technology to actually help us stay on different developments and know when we we don't want to stay on and when we can actually look and be like yes this is writing articles in a split second however I'm spending more time editing or I'm not really feeling like this is sharing my voice so then it's not just about doing the most advanced technology it's about like seeing it in terms of what we actually want to do yes yes and some exciting places I'm grabbing inspiration from this from and like the belief that I have yet to see invalidated is that The Human Experience way of being like whatever word you kind of want to put there is not it doesn't I haven't seen a case where I'm like oh that is at all being encroached in on by Ai and so that means there's this like Human Experience bit that you now have more tools for and some amazing ways I've heard of that actually coming to fation is like um someone like who threw an a really large festival and had only this much money for designers to like create stuff but now the designers could create more with different tools so all of a sudden you had a concert that was way more immersive like no one got laid off or blah blah blah it's just everyone was more able to create and the experience was all the more impactful um and I see that field super ripe and I see the signs that it's going to stay rip for a while right like if you look at the the coaching tools the entrepreneurial sort of Wellness tools that are being developed in AI you keep hearing everyone saying that it's taking longer than expected right and like I think those tools are going to help us like get to hear but there's still going to be like this whole element of Being Human in here and things to be created to help us like bridge that Gap and what's really beautiful is like you know what we like to think we're all the way up here but if you look at a number of models out of our full capacity we're all maybe a little bit lower and like what Humanity what we could be so I see this dance like happening well beyond our lifetimes like there's just there's so much space for that to happen there um so I like to think of it as like this positive reinforcing circle with a lot of potential yeah yeah like I I I don't know how how how or in in what depth you'll go into in the final artifact but that element of like the niche modification and this cumulative ratcheting also in very heterogeneously SL inequal distributed ratcheting of these intelligent activities in the niche and more active Niche and so like the learning environment has been books for many for hundreds of years static learning environment and I think the book still serves as a cultural reference point like people talk about the 2022 otive inference textbook more than many papers even though they're all just PDFs on our computer so it's not like it's that major of a difference it's it's barely even um a formatting difference um and and then also just it's like the the forest around us is kind of coming alive and so and um how how can we pull back and and generalize uh Beyond just trying to do the like um you know Windows 95 starter pack it's like that'll get you on Windows 95 but then maybe even the next version surp surprises you again and then you need another starter pack so it's like what can we pull back to and um that makes me think of Marshall mcluhan and even decades ago he was focusing on technology development from the sensory perspective and the perception action and so in in that frame was already able to forecast changes in technology and culture and all of this because from from our active inference setup the technology could be understood as as we interact with it even the telephone rather than just trying to look at the details of the technology as if the answer to be found would have was somehow like hidden in the technology rather than in our interactions with the technology so what what do you think about any of this Andor how how have any of your previous design and other experiences and research experiences like just how do you see those showing up differently in in this phas yeah actually I think I have that built into a section uh and we could just go there next yeah okay we'll come back to this one so I thought of that so I thought of your question and I see so many other people building active inference in different NES um oh Name Escapes me at the moment but like games and um negotiation apps and so one of the things I find so helpful is when I hear what other people are doing it sometimes inspires me so um and also there's the mentor mentee sort of um structure that you know in this sort of ecosystem isn't there in a formal sense but I was like well maybe I can do a bit of a share just in case it inspires others because that is something I can share so like um thinking of skill sets bringing over um I thought I'd Shar this framework that I'm thinking of doing it from so you have the a um the active inference impact book in the middle and it stands on four different um communities four different um ecosystems four different um often ways of approaching things and obviously the active inference in Institute um encompasses more than just Academia um but we have it there in one of those right and proactive in for instance specifically in through the lens of this project it has incredibly robust science and it has things like this community which again has just been so meaningful and important to me um and conferences like I'm looking forward to attending the active inference conference later this year I hope to see many of you there um or those who can attend um and then it pulls the best out of others areas right so like entrepreneurship we're doing it differently but from that group I'm pulling things like speed Innovation scrappiness getting creative with infrastructure um from like the big Tech space where I so I spent about a decade in Academia and about a decade in big Tech um I'm really pulling heavily from the design thinking processes and the user experience es um and then from the word we're around with we haven't found the perfect one cultural wisdom you know this is where um you can pull wisdom out of multi-generational experience um and it provides pulling in wisdom from different spiritual Traditions different religions um and just also The Human Experience right because there's so much we haven't yet been able to fully Define um in science that I often see a really beautiful interplay between the two it's like okay science is telling me this and I experienced this and then I take that back over to the science and oh sure enough there it is and now I experience this in a deeper level um and I like to compare the cultural wisdom and like um let's say the uh the science of active inference and we can get largely specific on the other hand too uh let's take um the larger space of Buddhist um thinking and I see artists or a scientist and an artist with different mediums painting the same picture um and I think you I think you can see that a lot more once you see it you start seeing it everywhere um and then it's so beautiful when you put them together um especially when you start pulling in more science and more um cultural wisdom and you all of a sudden just have this really beautiful piece full of depth awesome yeah one one thought on this um me many Maps many Maps um one though is that the the cultural like includes all of them these are their own cultures with their own histories and so then that's that kind of bottom up agential approach to social science that we've seen expl by many in active inference which is like thinking about um Academia as a niche and as a place where there's practices and modifications and entities moving and all these types of things um so not that that cultural bubble needs to go around all of them um just that this is an example of how we can use a lens to look into these different areas and make them comparable not because we're drawing concordances between what they do per se not because we're saying like what they do is the same but rather like here's this method that allows us to look at these things and put them on a and jux toose them and then where do we go from the jux toos but then it's like it just this is an example of of how active inference enables comparability across different settings yes you were saying that and I was like getting inspired for an image where it's more like the forest with like series of roots and different things within the floor that are all like helping each other and they're all there together and there's much more overlapping um so yeah that that makes sense to me um yeah so I thought I might throw up this more Niche piece of advice because I don't think it'll apply to as many but the few that it may I think it could be very impactful and I wanted to take a moment to really provide advice or P my like a perspective for those who have studies in active inference and are like now maybe especially earlier in their um careers and I often hear the if you will the sexiness behind going and building a startup and running straight out of the gate in that direction um I one concept I like putting on the table for people in those those sort of situations that they're evaluating what's a possible path for them to consider is that for those that are available to enter systems like big Tech um when I would used to hire somebody who was more alteristic um when I was within that ecosystem I would give them the advice that I very much held true to myself and that's like okay I'm going to play in this ecosystem now but I'm going to do it with the intention of building more direct positive impact in the future so what that looked like was learning amazing skills from very talented people in a short amount of time I worked really hard to save while I was in in these ecosystems so I could build something that had Direct positive impact um and do that myself in the future um do things like networking and for me it created a very effective path to to be where I am now um and one that I'm not sure with the Long View it might be for me in particular probably the more efficacious one um so it's just one I like to throw out there um as people kind of consider their options ahead of them um and share how that one can possibly be a resource yeah I I um don't have as much experience of course in in these areas just knowing mainly from the Academia the being from the Bay Area side and um yeah this question of which path to take a theme will probably come up again and again and also what will be interesting is who knows which and when and how many but active inference sub niches within these places most of their research and their projects are not open- Source or published in research journals per se however as the individuals across different groups all over the world and so on start learning and applying active inference then we may see some new two-way Communications rather than like someone kind of taking their active inference um spark and then feeling like it needs to be like protected while they're in moror or something like that I I don't think it it it is that way um but it could probably feel that way in certain settings um so it'll just be interesting to see how it all develops and as as the framework becomes more applic appable then there will be just even more and different kinds of ways to interface with tech and active inference yes um oh the additive idea I wanted to offer was Daniel I thought you did such a great job of that in the research fellow application uh because you made it very um there was an invitation and ability to do that from the traditional academic sense where you list all the papers or list the product development that you done and my Publications are none from like the past decade or very limited and so the opportunity to still apply for research fellow but showing product development instead of Publications was um just a really nice way to start to see some of that sort of come forward cool that's good to know um and it's been awesome to see what people have put in those fields oh that sounds intriguing yeah and and also research is is still a flavor and like you you are a research professional too um as perhaps other fellows fractals emerge like education or service and other areas than then again seeing what people bring that's our application active inference putting it out there then and then why would we want something different than what they want to share in response to that yeah I know it just sounds so exciting and full of potential um one last Model because I'm putting in the book and I really love it and I find it's just helpful to bring a lot of things together in a very simple way way um eeky guy I wish I had come across it like a decade ago but it's really nice reflection if you just want to set the intention to draw these four circles and journal on it um as you're thinking about how and what you might want to do with active inference um if you're into design thinking also putting it on the wall with sticky notes and moving sticky notes around you can even put active inference in the middle instead of the word eeky guy and like the more it resonates with several of them the more you put that sticky note closer to to the middle and the more it like falls out there off of it entirely you put the sticky note out so you actually do a self-load brainstorm for like half an hour an hour um with us if if you're trying to figure out you know what are some of those New Paths um a great way to kind of sort through all the uncertainty and possible paths to maybe Focus attention on ones that might be more um efficacious uh any other thoughts before I do a quick social media updates yeah go for this section and then if people have questions they should write them otherwi and then we'll we'll discuss any other topics okay this was more just to put it on people's radar and I can do it super fast but um we're playing around with again this is what's so great about self-funding and impact project uh we're going to explore contributing to popcorn Wellness which is essentially getting in touch with people who are in uh niches or domains where maybe they're not having some of this fed in as much as they could um so we're going to start with Instagram and once we kind of get our footing there a bit we're going to start iterating we're using more of an MVP sort of strategy given it social media and the iteration opportunities um and we'll explore sharing out um Concepts around active inference um as we build that in in the coming weeks um and also it's going to be there for us as a resarch as a a resource as a larger Community right if someone's releasing an active inference game or we think there's a talk or things like that we think will resonate with that audience like that's definitely going to be there for the the community to utilize um and just some fun notes we're also playing with like okay well if people are doom scrolling on um on let's say Instagram you know what are some seeds we could um put in and you know I don't think people are ready for the vocabulary where using and the ones that I find resonate the most in the existing vocabulary is words like mindful um so nine days super beautiful movie highly recommend um it's an example like I think we'll do movie recommends on like Friday nights and then having a Falls really cool idea she brings in what feel like active inference principles without using the words into a murder mystery novel I think she did like a business degree in Harvard or something like in hasm more stem background uh which is just a really fun like thing to do when you're unwinding in the evening is like pull some of this in to more of the entertainment Zone um great so I want to make sure to leave some time in case there were some questions yes okay for anyone who's watching um they can feel free to write um what are you wondering about slw what are your uncertainties SL policy distributions like um very comfortable with the word uncertainties less with policy distribution that's what I think I'm going to do did I learn that policies sequences of actions policy distribution distribution of uncertainty over sequences of action okay like I could there's a 50% chance I go left left a 50% chance I go forward left Etc okay um I'm not prepared to give a fully embodied answer on it or deeply thought out um some of the Beauties from working on this project is how much it forces the capacity to grow and hold uncertainty right like um funding an impact project off of limited savings um requires holding that every day and I actually created the belief that by doing that that will allow me to hold things that are challenging as the challenges of the projects change um and so it's really cool to see how the like holding the uncertainty around the project is strengthening that muscle and how it will increase the capacity um as this project grows um just to reflect on that like from a science research and from an act inference learning perspective like the the two things um holding uncertainty about certain aspects of a project while also being confident it's like that's like a dissertation chapter it's like we don't know how changes in humidity influence ant foraging in the desert however so that's an uncertainty we're holding we want to know I also don't know you know what date I'm going to drive down and I don't know who's going to do this and how but we do know that we are going to ask this question and we're going to pursue these methods and so it's like there are certain things that that then we learn to trust and then that helps us leave certain things open and then on so that's on the experiment side and the project and then on the learning active inference side it it's perhaps like a younger child reading a book with a lot of new words but I remember the early friston at all papers and it's just like every word is just like what and then now we can look back and say well that was literally I was being surprised by the sequence of words llms even though they're not necessarily doing active inference they also help us understand like yeah it's about predictions for the next token and about the next word so it's like the sentences just in your physical metaphor but I mean they they hit you word after word with novelty and symbology and sometimes just accepting and scanning and many codes of paint and then all these other strategies revisiting underlining searching using other tools asking people it's like all this other stuff but reading through those papers builds the skill and and the muscle for like almost name spaces and word games and similarly with learning about programming it's like oh in this program they use this letter for that and so it's like a little transient dictionary that has to be held with oh we're in this Nam space so this is how this and then um but then people really do talk that way and people use words differently so that that really is a useful skill to to observe surprise in language hold the space and ask what they really mean by this I wouldn't have said it that way yeah but they weren't me so they said it how they said it yeah yes to all of that and I'm so glad to hear that I wasn't the only one who when I tried to read some of Carl's stuff myself going back and reh highlighting and relooking up and like um but also yeah to build on that just a little just briefly a little bit more is like not only is all of this happening in this project but like on a personal level and I'm not sure how much I'll pull this into the book The the idea is everything personal brought into the book is a tool not like just me using a stage is as I've been navigating this project I've also been navigating a Health Challenge and I'm doing that in a foreign country um without the amazing insurance that I used to have because I want to do this impact project so it's like I'm strategically creating space gambling risking like putting it all out there in a deeply experiential way like like not only is it like learning all this stuff but it's like okay well like this is what it's going to take to play right it's much cheaper for me to live in Lebon than it is in San Francisco and I can then put more towards the project but then it's also like well how do I take care of myself and hold all this uncertainty yeah um well any other thoughts or or questions no that's it thanks for thanks for the chat cool yeah well we will wish you fun development and we'll share more and discuss more on on different collaborations sounds great thanks Daniel all right thank you farewell bye
