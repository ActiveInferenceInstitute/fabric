  "description": "Kristen Whittle\n\"Reflections and implications of a na\u00efve attitude to architecture\"\nThis proposed title is purposefully mischievous in that it derives from the SCHILLER/JUNGIAN sense of the word as it applies to \u2018architect as nature\u2019 and \u2018communicating an intimate form of nature in architecture\u2019. This would expand a conversation about the embedding of coherence (as it relates to free energy and active inference) into a sophisticated form of designed salutogenesis for architecture and cities and would enable me to encapsulate a number of thematics of past architectural projects I have designed including the new Australian Embassy in Washington DC.\n\nhttps://studiokristenwhittle.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/studiokristenwhittle/\nhttps://au.linkedin.com/company/studio-kristen-whittle\n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
