**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome to Active Inference Guest Stream 81.1. Today is April 23rd or 24th, depending on your location. We are joined by Hannah Bedell, who will discuss navigating uncertainty through the connection between affect and interoception. Thank you for joining us, Hannah. We will begin with a presentation followed by a discussion. I encourage everyone to submit their questions in the live chat, and I appreciate your participation.

Thank you, Daniel. I am excited to be here as well. As I mentioned earlier, I have been an avid follower of the YouTube channel for a considerable time, making this opportunity particularly gratifying. Today, I will present some of my doctoral research focused on arousal coherence, a concept that will be clarified shortly. The central theme revolves around how we may navigate uncertainty by understanding the relationship between affect and interoception.

I will discuss a paper I co-authored with Mark Helen Slaga and Ruben Linan, published in the *Neuroscience of Consciousness*. I will outline the content step by step. It is important to note from the outset that this concept has not yet been formally modeled; thus, my presentation and the paper consist primarily of claims supported by existing experiments, models, and simulations. I aim to synthesize prior ideas and explore their potential implications, particularly concerning interoceptive self-inference and deep affective inference, as well as precision optimization.

The claims I will make are as follows: First, autonomic arousal states correlate with changes in uncertainty, a relationship that encompasses several dimensions, which I will clarify in the subsequent slides. Second, accurately inferring autonomic arousal is crucial for how our brains estimate uncertainty. Third, effective arousal may optimize our confidence in autonomic prediction errors, potentially influencing the accuracy of our interoceptive autonomic inferences. This leads me to the central concept of the paper: arousal coherence.

Arousal coherence can be illustrated simply, albeit oversimplified, by depicting changes in autonomic arousal over time—showing increases and decreases in coherent affective arousal that aligns with autonomic arousal, versus incoherent affective arousal that dissociates from autonomic changes. While this is a basic representation, it captures the essence of arousal coherence, which I argue impacts our ability to adapt to various uncertainties.

Finally, I will discuss meta-awareness of arousal—the understanding of one’s own arousal states—suggesting that this higher-order representation may enhance arousal coherence. I will briefly touch on the benefits of heightened arousal coherence. It is essential to clarify that I view affective arousal as a lower-order prediction distinct from emotions such as stress, anxiety, or excitement. High arousal levels can be common across these emotional states, while lower arousal corresponds to relaxation.

Regarding autonomic arousal, I will not differentiate between sympathetic and parasympathetic activation or their balance. Instead, I will discuss general increases or decreases in autonomic arousal, as indicated by metrics such as heart rate or pupil dilation.

I have not included a primer on active inference, given the audience's familiarity with the concepts. In basic terms, I conceptualize action and perception as inseparable inferences operating in a loop. These inferences can be nested, and one layer of inference may influence others. Additionally, the concept of precision is critical, as it serves as an inverse estimate of uncertainty—indicating confidence in signals or beliefs.

If any terms I use are unclear, please feel free to interrupt. I am also open to discussions about formal modeling outside of this presentation.

Let us proceed to the first claim, unless there are any questions, Daniel. 

The first claim is straightforward: autonomic states correlate with changes in uncertainty. Numerous lines of evidence support this assertion, dating back several years. Notably, the work of Y and Dian in the early 2000s examined various neuromodulators of autonomic arousal, particularly adrenaline and norepinephrine, and their relationship with pupil dilation in relation to uncertainty. Additionally, we can consider changes in volatility and surprise, as well as violations of precise expectations, which elicit embodied changes in response to environmental uncertainty.

One notable study by Debka and colleagues at UCL involved a probabilistic learning task in which participants learned associations between two rocks—one of which concealed a snake, resulting in an electric shock. They manipulated the probability of finding a snake under each rock and observed that participants whose autonomic arousal responses adapted to uncertainty were better at learning these associations. This suggests that the body’s response to uncertainty significantly influences one’s capacity to learn from it.

Another piece of evidence comes from pharmacological studies where suppression of autonomic arousal responses, such as through the administration of a drug, resulted in reduced learning when environmental conditions changed. Thus, the ability to track changes in autonomic arousal is crucial for effectively updating one’s understanding of uncertainty.

The second claim posits that inferring our autonomic arousal states aids in estimating uncertainty. This idea draws heavily from the work of Mik Allen, who emphasizes interoceptive self-inference. By inferring autonomic arousal states, we can better estimate changes in expected uncertainty. For instance, variations in heartbeat are accompanied by sensory noise that can impair perception. By anticipating these changes, the brain can adjust its expectations regarding precision accordingly.

This concept can be extended to various temporal levels. For example, if heartbeat influences precision, then heart rate over time will also impact uncertainty estimates. It is crucial to note that the brain can infer expected states and likely exert control over these states, allowing for adjustments based on contextual needs.

Another interesting observation is that during periods of perceptual uncertainty, heart rate may slow, providing more time for predictability and enhancing opportunities for precise sensory sampling.

Thus, I propose that interoceptive self-inference plays a vital role in estimating uncertainty, and I will explore what factors may influence interoceptive precision. To effectively infer interoceptive conditions, one must adapt interoceptive precision in response to changing circumstances. Typically, interoceptive precision is regarded as high, as maintaining homeostatic states is critical for survival. However, circumstances can change, necessitating adaptability in confidence regarding interoceptive beliefs and errors. This adaptability has significant implications for health.

Recent work by Ryan Smith demonstrated that individuals with anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and eating disorders exhibited reduced adaptability in their interoceptive precision estimates compared to healthy individuals. 

The third claim relates to affective inference, drawing on various studies in this area. I particularly appreciate the work of Casper Hesp et al., who examined higher-order affect as an abstraction of lower-order inferences, representing changes in lower-level uncertainty. Deviations in lower-level uncertainty or errors may ascend to a higher level of affective inference, where arousal plays a crucial role. This arousal serves to orient individuals toward signals that may resolve future uncertainty.

This aligns with earlier ideas posited by researchers such as Faf in 2006, who discussed the role of cortical arousal in information gain. Additionally, research by Yana Sagala and colleagues has indicated that affective arousal related to novelty and information gain adheres to similar principles.

Furthermore, a study by Candia Rivera and colleagues examined heart-brain coupling during emotional experiences. Their findings revealed that emotional stimuli modulated heart activity, which subsequently influenced cortical responses, indicating a bidirectional processing relationship between affect and bodily signals. Importantly, the flow of information from the body to the brain was modulated by arousal levels, emphasizing the significance of affective arousal in optimizing interoceptive precision.

This leads us back to the concept of arousal coherence—the correlation between autonomic and affective arousal within an individual over time. If affective states recruit bodily signals to model current conditions and changes in autonomic arousal reflect alterations in uncertainty and precision, then affective arousal may serve as a metacognitive mechanism to regulate and represent the precision of interoceptive self-inference at a conscious level.

The failure to adapt interoceptive precision in response to autonomic changes suggests that effective arousal is instrumental in facilitating coherence, allowing for better responsiveness to changing levels of uncertainty. By monitoring and tracking fluctuations in uncertainty, individuals can enhance their learning and adapt more effectively to their environment, leading to improved mental well-being.

Research indicates that arousal coherence is associated with better emotional awareness, self-regulation, and lower anxiety and depression levels. While most research has focused on autonomic markers, such as heart rate or pupil dilation, it is essential to distinguish between effective arousal and emotions.

Lastly, I wish to emphasize the importance of meta-awareness of arousal, drawing from the work of Sandid Smith. I propose that meta-awareness of arousal functions as a higher-order monitoring and control mechanism over lower-order arousal processes, shaping the responsiveness of these processes to errors, including interoceptive and autonomic errors. Evidence suggests that training this meta-awareness can enhance coherence in arousal, as demonstrated by research showing that meditators exhibit higher arousal coherence.

In summary, the integration of these claims illustrates how autonomic arousal tracks changes in uncertainty, informing future precision estimates. Effective arousal operates at a higher temporal level, enhancing expectations and precision regarding interoceptive conditions. Meta-arousal allows for learning about these precision-weighted errors in effective arousal, fostering greater coherence and facilitating the flow of information regarding changing uncertainty from the autonomic level to conscious awareness.

I have numerous ideas for future research in this area, including exploring the association between arousal coherence and adaptive updating of uncertainty estimates. I am excited to analyze data shared by De Burker and colleagues from their probabilistic learning study. Additionally, I plan to investigate the relationship between arousal coherence and emotional awareness, as well as the effects of interventions aimed at increasing awareness of arousal, such as mindfulness practices.

The data for this research is readily available, and I encourage collaboration with anyone interested in exploring these concepts further. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with esteemed colleagues on my first paper and appreciate the valuable feedback received from reviewers.

Thank you for your attention. I am eager to engage in discussion and answer any questions you may have.
