**Title:** Integration of Experience and Exposure Rating in Reinsurance Using Generative Models

## Summary:
A new integrated framework for reinsurance is proposed, combining experience rating and exposure rating into a cohesive system that leverages generative models for improved risk assessment and decision-making. This approach aims to reduce bias and uncertainty in claims estimates, ultimately leading to enhanced profitability and better risk selection.

## Description:
Reinsurance serves as a safety net for insurance companies by providing coverage against claims. Traditionally, two main approaches are utilized to assess risk: experience rating, which projects past claims into the future, and exposure rating, which evaluates current exposure to risks. This report introduces a new framework that integrates both approaches using a generative model to simulate claims and calibrate estimates. 

The generative model creates artificial claims data based on historical patterns, allowing for a detailed analysis of claims without relying solely on potentially outdated experience data. The model is calibrated with Bayesian inference, ensuring that it reflects real-world outcomes accurately. This dual approach not only enhances the accuracy of risk assessments but also mitigates the inherent biases present in traditional methods, particularly during fluctuating market conditions.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Collect historical claims data from a reinsurance company focusing on a specific segment (e.g., property and casualty).
2. Implement a generative model to simulate claims based on the historical data, adjusting for different market conditions (soft and hard markets).
3. Calibrate the model using Bayesian inference to ensure that simulated claims align with actual claims reported over time.
4. Compare the results of the integrated approach with traditional experience and exposure ratings to assess improvements in accuracy and reduced bias.

## Impact:
The proposed integrated framework has the potential to revolutionize reinsurance practices by significantly reducing the uncertainty and bias in claims estimates. By improving the accuracy of risk assessments, this approach can lead to better underwriting decisions, increased profitability, and a more resilient insurance ecosystem. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions and reduce adverse developments in claims will ultimately benefit all stakeholders involved in the reinsurance process.
