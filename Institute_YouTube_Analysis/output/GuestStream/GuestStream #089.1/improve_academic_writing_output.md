**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome. Today is September 30th, 2024, and we are engaged in Active Inference Guest Stream 89.1, focusing on a generic framework for a coherent integration of experience and exposure rating in reinsurance. I would like to extend my gratitude to our guests, Stefan Berer and Rolan Bori, for joining us today. Stefan, we look forward to your presentation and the ensuing discussion.

Thank you, Daniel. Welcome, everyone. I will provide a brief overview of my presentation, which centers on reinsurance. Some attendees may already be familiar with reinsurance, but for those who are not, I will clarify its fundamental aspects. Essentially, reinsurance provides coverage to insurance companies, allowing them to manage risk. When reinsurance companies issue contracts to cover these risks, they must assess the associated risks accurately. Traditionally, two main approaches for risk assessment have been employed: experience rating and exposure rating. My presentation introduces a new integrated framework that synthesizes these two approaches.

The framework comprises three core components: the first is a generative model, which simulates artificial claims. Before conducting any analysis, it is essential to reduce these high-dimensional, complex data sets into a manageable number of reduced random variables. This reduction is achieved through Bayesian inference, which aids in calibrating the model. 

Historically, the experience rating approach involved using past claims data to project future claims activity. For example, Kepler analyzed historical data to derive laws governing planetary motion, while Newton formulated these laws based on more fundamental principles. This analogy illustrates the difference between modeling data and modeling the underlying reality. In biological terms, we can compare Aristotle's principles to Darwin's evolutionary theory. In statistics, Fisher represents classical statistics, while Bayes represents modern Bayesian approaches. 

In my talk, I will first provide background information to explain the relevance of this framework, link it to active inference, identify challenges we face, and outline a roadmap toward a solution. I will also present examples. Please note that I will not be displaying any formulas; those interested in the mathematical details can refer to the accompanying paper.

To begin, I have analyzed real numbers from a reinsurance company, specifically focusing on the property and casualty (PNC) reinsurance segment. This segment is distinct from Swiss Re’s corporate solutions and life and health segments. Swiss Re developed an internal framework for the economic valuation of its business approximately 25 years ago and began publishing results in 2013. The critical aspect of this framework involves present values of future cash flows, which are assessed by underwriting year rather than financial year. 

We observe that gross premiums have increased from approximately 13 billion in 2013 to around 18 billion in 2023. The mean of net premiums serves as a reference point. A substantial portion of these premiums—approximately 85%—is allocated to cover claims, while around 10% accounts for the reinsurer's internal expenses. Other elements such as taxes and capital costs contribute relatively minor amounts. 

One significant concern is the adverse development of claims, which can lead to substantial financial surprises. Underwriters often underestimate claims during soft market conditions and overestimate them during hard market conditions. This creates an opportunity for improvement, potentially reducing uncertainty and enhancing profitability.

In conclusion, the integrated framework I propose offers a systematic approach to risk assessment in reinsurance. By applying generative models and Bayesian inference, we can refine our understanding of risk and improve decision-making processes.

Thank you for your attention. I am now open to discussion and questions.
