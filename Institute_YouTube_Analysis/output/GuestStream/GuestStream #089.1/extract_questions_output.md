- Thank you both for joining. Stefan, to you for a presentation, we'll look forward to that.
- Can you explain what reinsurance is?
- What are the two different approaches traditionally used in reinsurance?
- What is the relevance of your presentation?
- Can you point out some of the challenges we are facing in this attempt?
- Can you provide a roadmap for a solution?
- Can you show some examples?
- Do you think the world is ready for this?
- Is there any form of acceptance for this?
- How do we get people to want to do something new?
- Could the generative model be included as a calibration in effect but on the existing projection of claims history to the future?
- Is there a way to make the thing that weâ€™re aspiring to migrate towards a part of an existing part of the analysis?
- Do you have any thoughts on the biological analogies to the reinsurer's or underwriter's role?
- Where are you going to go with this work or what are your directions?
