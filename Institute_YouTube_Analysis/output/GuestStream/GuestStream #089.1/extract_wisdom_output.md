# SUMMARY
Stefan Berer presents a new framework for integrating experience and exposure rating in reinsurance.

# IDEAS:
- Reinsurance provides coverage to insurance companies, mitigating their risk exposure through contracts.
- Experience rating uses historical claims data, while exposure rating assesses potential future risks.
- A generative model can simulate claims for better risk assessment in reinsurance.
- The new integrated framework aims to merge experience and exposure ratings into a cohesive approach.
- Underwriters often underestimate claims during soft markets and overestimate during hard markets.
- The economic valuation of reinsurance is essential for understanding profitability and cash flow.
- Claims reporting can take years, complicating accurate financial forecasting for reinsurers.
- A generative model allows for calibration against past claims to improve future projections.
- Claims management and premium rates fluctuate cyclically, impacting profitability in reinsurance.
- The presence of uncertainty in underwriting can be reduced with better risk selection.
- Using Bayesian inference helps calibrate models based on observed claims and simulated data.
- A high-dimensional space for claims data requires simplification for practical analysis.
- Improved underwriting processes can significantly reduce potential losses and enhance profitability.
- The integration of artificial intelligence in reinsurance could revolutionize risk assessment practices.
- Corporations, like humans, use models to represent the external world and manage resources.
- The reinsurance industry must adapt to technological advancements or risk being outpaced by competitors.

# INSIGHTS:
