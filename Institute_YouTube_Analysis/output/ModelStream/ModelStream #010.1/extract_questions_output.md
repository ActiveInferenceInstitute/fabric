- how are we going to build a drone with RX infer?
- if we have crafted this model and we want this model actually to do something, what does inference allow us to compute?
- what forces act on this drone?
- how does our state evolve over time?
- what are the ideal characteristics and backgrounds to have if somebody wanted to help develop RX infer with your organization?
- is the reactive part based on events to trigger the pipeline or based on signals?
- does RX infer have any examples available for categorical control spaces?
- to what extent can you guys parallelize within RX infer?
- have you guys thought about approaching big players like Amazon Web Services to incorporate this into their tools?
- what are the largest current challenges to the reactive message passing paradigm for doing this kind of approximate Bayesian inference?
