**Title:** Insecure Direct Object Reference in Drone Control Model Allows Unauthorized Access to Drone States

## Summary:
The RX Infer drone control model is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in its state management, allowing an unauthorized user to access and manipulate the state of the drone by altering request parameters.

## Description:
In the RX Infer drone control model, the state of the drone is managed through a set of parameters that can be manipulated via requests to the model. However, the lack of proper access controls allows an attacker to change these parameters to access or modify the state of the drone without authorization.

For example, if a request is made to retrieve or update the state of the drone using a specific identifier (e.g., drone ID), an attacker can modify this ID in the request to target a different drone's state. This could allow the attacker to gain control over the drone, change its flight path, or even disable it entirely.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Set up the RX Infer drone control model and ensure it is running.
2. Identify the endpoint for accessing drone states, e.g., `GET /drone/state?id=<drone_id>`.
3. Make a request to the endpoint with a valid `drone_id` to retrieve the state of that drone.
4. Modify the `drone_id` parameter in the request to that of another drone (e.g., `GET /drone/state?id=<another_drone_id>`).
5. Observe that the response returns the state of the drone associated with the modified `drone_id`, demonstrating unauthorized access.

## Impact:
This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the state and control of drones within the system. By exploiting this IDOR vulnerability, an attacker could alter flight paths, disable drones, or potentially cause safety hazards. This could lead to severe consequences, including damage to property, endangerment of lives, and legal liabilities for the organization managing the drones. Immediate remediation is required to enforce access controls and validate user permissions for all state-related requests.
