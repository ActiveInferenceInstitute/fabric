Building a drone sounds complicated, but it’s really about understanding the basics and breaking the problem down into smaller pieces. We’re using a tool called RX Infer, which is designed to help with probabilistic programming. 

First, we need to grasp the physics involved. A drone is subject to forces—namely, the lift generated by its rotors and the pull of gravity. By analyzing these forces, we can create equations that define how the drone moves. You don’t need to be a physics expert; just remember the key concepts. 

Next, we’ll build a model using these equations. This involves creating a function in Julia, the language RX Infer uses. We’ll define the drone’s state—its position, velocity, and angle—and how these change over time based on the forces applied. 

Once we have our model, we want to run simulations to see how the drone behaves in different scenarios. RX Infer allows us to do this efficiently through message passing, which lets us compute probabilities without overwhelming computational demands. 

The beauty of this approach is that it’s not just about making a drone fly; it’s about learning how to leverage tools like RX Infer to tackle complex problems. By the end, you’ll have a solid foundation to start building your own applications, whether it's a drone or something entirely different. So let’s get started and see where this journey takes us!
