- Can you share with us about the RX environments?
- I actually had a question, do you understand C as well?
- Did you just use your custom commands that you just sent yourself?
- Is it possible to use only RX environments or is it supposed to be always used in collaboration with RX and fur?
- Do you see that as kind of superfluous in the RX environments setting or is it fine to use that approach?
- Is there a subtlety there?
- Can you point as to or a fragment of code that shows us how to do that?
- Is my mic better now?
- Do you think you could add a discrete control space example for us as well?
- How would you deal with the setting of multiple ant nestmates moving around and modifying the pheromones on the ground?
- Could you explain that again please?
- How do you think the iterative procedure would work in terms of action and observation?
- What’s kind of the biggest problem set of problems you’re looking to do?
