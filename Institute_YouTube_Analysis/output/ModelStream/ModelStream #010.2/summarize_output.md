# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The RX environments package enhances reactive Bayesian inference by enabling real-time interaction and communication between agents and environments.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. RX environments is a lightweight package for creating reactive environments.
2. It complements the RX infer package for developing reactive agents.
3. Entities in RX environments can communicate via their own Markov blankets.
4. The package allows for real-time manipulation of environments and agents.
5. Multi-agent environments are natively supported in RX environments.
6. The reactive paradigm enables asynchronous communication between agents and environments.
7. Users can create environments without needing predefined action timings.
8. Free energy and other observations can be extracted for analysis.
9. Agents can operate independently of the RX infer package but benefit from its features.
10. Future work involves improving the integration of RX environments with RX infer.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. RX environments provides a flexible approach to reactive agent development.
2. Real-time control and multi-agent capabilities are significant advantages.
3. The communication protocol allows for more natural interactions between entities.
4. Understanding the reactive nature opens new research avenues in agent behavior.
5. The package facilitates experimentation with both physical and abstract environments.
