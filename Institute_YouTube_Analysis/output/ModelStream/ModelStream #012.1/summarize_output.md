# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
The presentation discusses an active inference model of optimism bias, its implications for mental health, and potential clinical applications.

# MAIN POINTS:
1. Optimism bias leads to better life outcomes despite unrealistic expectations.
2. Active inference is used as a tool in computational psychiatry.
3. The model explores the relationship between optimism and mental health interventions.
4. Optimistic beliefs encourage healthier behaviors and lower health risks.
5. Simulations were run to understand how optimism bias is lost or maintained.
6. A belief updating task was used to ground the model in empirical literature.
7. The two-arm bandit task measures optimistic action and engagement.
8. Variability in optimism levels reflects individual differences in humans.
9. Simple models are preferred for clinical application in psychiatry.
10. Future research aims to fit participant data to the optimism model.

# TAKEAWAYS:
1. Optimism can lead to improved mental and physical health outcomes.
2. Active inference models can help understand cognitive biases like optimism.
3. Simple models are essential for practical applications in clinical settings.
4. Future studies may explore how interventions can enhance optimism.
5. Engaging in positive actions can change environmental perceptions and outcomes.
