**Title:** Active Inference Model of Optimism Bias: Implications for Mental Health Interventions

## Summary:
This report discusses an active inference model developed to explain the optimism biasâ€”a cognitive bias where expectations exceed reality. The model has implications for computational psychiatry, particularly in understanding and potentially treating conditions like depression and anxiety by enhancing optimism.

## Description:
The optimism bias is characterized by a tendency to overestimate positive outcomes, which is linked to various health benefits, including reduced risk of chronic illness and improved mental health. The researchers aimed to explore how active inference, a framework for understanding decision-making and learning, can model this bias and its potential therapeutic applications.

The study involved three simulations: 
1. **Loss of Optimism Bias**: This simulation examined how negative life events during development could lead to reduced optimism. The model indicated that agents exposed to more negative events tended to have lower optimism levels.
2. **Belief Updating Task**: This task was designed to replicate human optimism studies, showing that optimistic agents updated their beliefs more favorably in response to positive information compared to pessimistic agents.
3. **Two-Arm Bandit Task**: This simulation assessed decision-making behavior, revealing that optimistic agents were more likely to take risks and engage in rewarding activities, contrary to pessimistic agents who tended to avoid risks.

These findings suggest that optimism is not only beneficial for health but can also be systematically modeled and potentially modified through targeted interventions.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. **Simulate Loss of Optimism**: Set up a hierarchical active inference model with varying levels of exposure to positive and negative events to observe how these events influence optimism levels.
2. **Conduct Belief Updating Task**: Implement a belief updating simulation where agents estimate risks and update their beliefs based on feedback, comparing optimistic and pessimistic responses.
3. **Run Two-Arm Bandit Task**: Design a task where agents choose between high-risk/high-reward and low-risk/low-reward options, analyzing decision-making patterns based on their optimism levels.

## Supporting Material/References:

## Impact:
This research provides a foundational model for understanding how optimism can be quantified and potentially enhanced in clinical settings. By linking optimism to decision-making and behavioral engagement, it opens avenues for developing interventions that could alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression, ultimately improving patient outcomes in mental health.
