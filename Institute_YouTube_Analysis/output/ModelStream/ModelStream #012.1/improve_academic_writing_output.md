**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome. Today is June 27th, 2024, Z UTC, and we are convening for the 12.1 session of the active inference model stream, featuring Beth Fiser and Yaka Howi. This session will include a presentation and discussion on an active inference model pertaining to the optimism bias. I extend my gratitude to both of you for joining us, and I now invite Beth to commence her presentation.

Thank you, Daniel. I am Beth, and I will discuss our recent preprint regarding an active inference model of the optimism bias. This research has been conducted alongside Chris White, whose work many of you may be familiar with. We are currently situated at the Mones Center for Consciousness and Contemplative Studies in Australia, and this project forms part of my PhD work, which I am undertaking under Yaka's supervision. 

To begin, I will provide an overview of the optimism bias, discussing its significance and my interest in studying it. Subsequently, I will introduce the field of computational psychiatry, illustrating how I employ active inference not solely to delve into the intricacies of the theory, but primarily as a tool within this discipline. I believe it is essential to elucidate how we can apply these models in practical contexts, outlining the objectives of my research. Following that, I will present the simulations included in our paper, concluding with some insights.

The optimism bias is a cognitive bias whereby individuals hold expectations that exceed reality. Interestingly, one might assume that to achieve optimal decision-making and life outcomes, one should accurately represent information as it exists in reality, without harboring inflated expectations. However, the optimism bias demonstrates that believing in a more favorable outcome—overestimating the likelihood of positive events—can lead to improved life results. Research indicates that individuals exhibiting optimism experience a reduced risk of mortality, lower rates of cardiovascular disease, diminished fatigue, and chronic illness, as well as increased engagement in self-care behaviors. Furthermore, a notable study found that optimistic individuals displayed enhanced cognitive functioning following traumatic brain injury. Optimists tend to earn higher incomes, possess stronger immune systems, and exhibit lower levels of anxiety and worry overall.

This raises the question: why does an optimistic outlook—thinking that circumstances are better than they are—result in such positive outcomes? To illustrate this, consider the following scenario: if one were to hold realistic beliefs, they would acknowledge that 50% of marriages end in divorce, that regular exercise reduces the risk of heart disease by 14%, and that a healthy diet decreases the risk of cancer by 10%. In contrast, an optimistic individual might believe that only 10% of marriages end in divorce, that exercising reduces their risk of heart disease by 40%, and that eating well lowers their cancer risk by 30%. Such optimistic beliefs are likely to motivate individuals to engage in healthier behaviors—eating well, exercising, and actively seeking companionship—thereby enhancing their chances of achieving positive outcomes. This exemplifies the notion of minimizing the risk of missed opportunities; by participating in activities and striving for improvement, individuals significantly increase their likelihood of positive experiences.

Given the correlation between optimism and mental health, it is noteworthy that individuals suffering from anxiety and depression often exhibit a lack of optimism. They may possess expectations that are either worse than reality (pessimism) or aligned with reality (depressive realism). My research interest lies in exploring whether it is possible to enhance optimism as an intervention for depression and anxiety.

To elucidate how I plan to achieve this and the role of active inference in my research, I will first outline some foundational concepts within computational psychiatry. The initial step in any scientific inquiry involves formulating a conceptual framework. For this project, I have extensively reviewed literature on active inference and optimism, seeking to identify how active inference can effectively model optimism, as well as the predictions we can derive from these models. This foundational work is critical, as it serves as the basis for subsequent simulations.

Once the conceptual model is established, we can proceed to run simulations, which is what we have accomplished in this paper. This iterative process of simulating optimism in the context of active inference allows us to examine whether our expectations align with our theoretical framework. Following the simulations, the next step involves fitting empirical data to our models. Running these simulations provides valuable background knowledge, enabling us to design experiments that effectively align with our findings.

In this study, we conducted three simulations, referred to as experiments. The first experiment simulated the loss of the optimism bias, a phenomenon observed across various species, indicating that optimism is an adaptive bias innate to many organisms. Research demonstrates that environmental factors experienced during childhood can significantly influence levels of optimism, with adverse experiences correlating with lower optimism. Our aim was to examine how optimism may be lost or maintained throughout development.

The second experiment applied our optimism bias state factor from the first experiment to a belief updating task commonly utilized in optimism literature involving human participants. We sought to ground our model in empirical findings, and we anticipated that replicating established results would lend further credibility to our model.

The third experiment involved a modified two-arm bandit task designed to measure optimistic action. Given that optimistic individuals tend to engage more actively with the world, we aimed to develop a task that quantifies this engagement.

In summary, the optimism state factor was formalized as a state variable within our generative model, applicable across various simulations and tasks. This model encompasses optimistic and pessimistic states, allowing us to examine how optimism influences decision-making in diverse contexts. The findings from our simulations indicate that exposure to a greater proportion of negatively valenced events correlates with reduced optimism. Moreover, we observed that optimistic agents exhibited a flat likelihood matrix, signifying that arousal did not significantly influence their state, in contrast to pessimistic agents who demonstrated heightened sensitivity to arousal signals.

In conclusion, our work presents initial support for an active inference model of optimism, showcasing its applicability across different task settings. We anticipate that this model can be further refined by fitting participant data to better understand the dynamics of optimism and its implications for mental health interventions. Thank you for your attention.
