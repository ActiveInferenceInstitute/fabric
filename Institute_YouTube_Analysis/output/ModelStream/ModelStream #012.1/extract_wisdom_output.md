- Optimism is linked to lower levels of anxiety and better cognitive functioning post-trauma.
- Optimistic agents are more likely to take risks and engage in rewarding activities.
- Exposure to negative events can diminish optimism, affecting future decision-making and health.
- Simulations reveal that optimism is an adaptive bias present across various species.
- Simple models are crucial for practical use in clinical settings to diagnose and treat mental health issues.
- Understanding optimism can help improve precision psychiatry by tailoring interventions to individual experiences.
- Active inference provides a framework for exploring the mechanisms of cognitive biases in human behavior.
