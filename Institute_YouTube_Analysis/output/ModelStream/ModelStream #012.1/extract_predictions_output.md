- The optimism bias is a cognitive bias leading to better life outcomes.
- Optimism may reduce risks of mortality and cardiovascular diseases.
- Optimistic individuals engage more in self-care behaviors.
- Higher optimism correlates with better cognitive functioning post-injury.
- The optimism bias may improve mental health in anxiety and depression.
- Increased optimism could be a potential intervention for depression and anxiety.
- Future models could help clinicians understand optimism's role in patient care.
- Simulations show that exposure to negative events can decrease optimism.
- Agents in optimistic states update beliefs more positively to good news.
- Optimistic agents show better engagement in high-risk, high-reward situations.
