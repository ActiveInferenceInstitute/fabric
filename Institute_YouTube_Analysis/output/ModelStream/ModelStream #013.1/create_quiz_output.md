Subject: Active Inference and Quantum Decision Theory
* Learning objective: Understand the synthesis of the Born rule with reinforcement learning.
    - Question 1: How does the synthesis of the Born rule with reinforcement learning challenge traditional interpretations of quantum mechanics?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: In what ways does the paper propose that decision theory can be applied to quantum systems, and what are the implications of this application for our understanding of quantum behavior?
    - Answer 2:
    
    - Question 3: Discuss the significance of the Proto Quantum assumption in the context of the research findings. How does this assumption bridge classical and quantum theories?
    - Answer 3:
