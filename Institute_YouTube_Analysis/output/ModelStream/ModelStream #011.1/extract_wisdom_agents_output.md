SUMMARY
- Hadi Vafa presents a new model, the Poisson Variational Autoencoder, to study brain-like artificial neural networks using insights from neuroscience.

IDEAS:
- The study of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can help understand the brain's function.
- Current data collection methods in neuroscience are challenging and may take millions of years to achieve.
- Perception involves combining sensory data with prior experiences to create subjective experiences.
- The ASES room illusion demonstrates how prior expectations can distort perception.
- Bayesian probability formalizes the concept of perception as inference.
- Rate coding suggests neurons communicate through the frequency of action potentials.
- Predictive coding posits that the brain anticipates sensory inputs and adjusts based on discrepancies.
- The PAE (Poisson Autoencoder) model draws from perception as inference, rate coding, and predictive coding.
- The architecture of VAEs consists of an encoder and a decoder that reconstructs input data.
- A key challenge in VAEs is posterior collapse, where latent variables stop encoding information.
- The PAE optimizes a loss function that resembles sparse coding principles.

- "The idea is that perception involves two components: an external component and an internal component."
- "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
- "The essence of perception as inference states that when you show an image to the brain, it thinks what latent configuration likely caused my current observation."
- "Rate coding is the idea that neurons encode information in the rate of these spikes."
