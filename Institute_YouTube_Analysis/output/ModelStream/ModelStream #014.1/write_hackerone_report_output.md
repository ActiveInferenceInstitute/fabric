**Title:** Lack of Proper Reward Specification in Active Inference Leads to Suboptimal Exploration-Exploitation Trade-offs

## Summary:
The implementation of reward specification in Active Inference can lead to inefficient exploration-exploitation trade-offs, potentially causing agents to get stuck in local optima. The expectation of balancing pragmatic and epistemic values in decision-making processes is critical but currently lacks robust methodologies to automatically adjust preferences dynamically.

## Description:
Active Inference (AI) aims to minimize expected free energy (EF) by balancing reward acquisition (pragmatic value) and information seeking (epistemic value). However, if the reward specification is not carefully calibrated, agents may become overly focused on information gathering rather than achieving their goals, leading to local optima traps.

In the context of AI, the reward function is crucial as it influences the decision-making process of agents. If preferences are set such that the gain in pragmatic value is consistently overshadowed by the information value lost, agents may pursue information at the expense of task completion. This dynamic can cause them to wander within a local optimum without effectively progressing toward their primary objectives.

Additionally, the research highlights the need for a principled approach to dynamically adjust these reward specifications in real-time, allowing agents to adaptively manage their focus between exploration for information and exploitation for rewards.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Implement an Active Inference agent with a reward structure that emphasizes both pragmatic and epistemic values.
2. Set the preferences in such a way that the pragmatic value gained after a belief update is always less than or equal to the information value lost.
3. Observe the agent's behavior in a controlled environment, noting instances where it becomes stuck in local optima due to excessive focus on information gathering rather than reward acquisition.

## Supporting Material/References:

## Impact:
This vulnerability in reward specification significantly hampers the efficiency of Active Inference agents, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world applications. Without a robust mechanism for dynamically adjusting reward preferences, these agents risk failing to achieve their goals, which undermines the effectiveness of Active Inference as a decision-making framework. Addressing this issue is critical for the development of more reliable and effective AI systems that can adaptively balance exploration and exploitation.
