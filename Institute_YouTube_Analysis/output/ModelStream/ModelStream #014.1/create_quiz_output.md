Subject: Active Inference, Value of Information, and Reward Specification

* Learning objective: Understand the expected free energy objective for action planning in active inference.
    - Question 1: How does the expected free energy (EF) objective decompose into expected value and epistemic value terms in active inference, and what implications does this have for action selection?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Discuss the role of the expected K divergence in defining epistemic value within the EF framework. How does this influence the agent's exploration behavior?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: In what ways does the EF objective facilitate the learning of comprehensive models of the environment compared to traditional reward-maximizing agents?
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Differentiate between the characteristics of active inference and reinforcement learning approaches.
    - Question 1: Compare and contrast the exploration-exploitation trade-off strategies employed in active inference and model-based reinforcement learning. What are the theoretical underpinnings of each approach?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: How does the concept of state coverage differ between active inference agents and traditional reinforcement learning agents in a given environment?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: Discuss the significance of belief updates in active inference versus the reward-centric focus in reinforcement learning. What are the potential advantages of the former?
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Explore the implications of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) on planning strategies.
    - Question 1: Explain how belief states serve as sufficient statistics in partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) and their impact on the formulation of optimal policies.
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Discuss the challenges associated with planning in POMDPs as opposed to fully observable MDPs. How does the complexity of belief representation affect planning efficiency?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of using variational updates in the context of active inference as compared to exact Bayesian updates in POMDPs?
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Analyze the role of information gain in optimizing decision-making processes.
    - Question 1: Define the concept of the value of information and explain its relevance in the context of decision-making under uncertainty.
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: How can the expected value of perfect information be extended to apply in POMDP settings? What implications does this have for the agent's decision-making capabilities?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: Discuss how information gain can be incorporated into the reward structure of active inference agents to enhance their performance in uncertain environments.
    - Answer 3:
