Subject: Active Inference and Information Seeking

* Learning objective: Understanding the principles of active data selection and its application in experimental design.
    - Question 1: How does the concept of active data selection differ from traditional data sampling methods in the context of experimental design?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Discuss the role of predictive entropy and conditional entropy in guiding active data selection. How do these concepts influence the decision-making process in experimental settings?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: Explain how the principles of active inference can be applied to non-biological contexts, such as clinical diagnostics or machine learning. Provide an example of such an application.
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Analyzing the impact of temporal dynamics on data selection and information gathering.
    - Question 1: Describe the challenges associated with modeling temporal dynamics in active inference. What are the implications for time sampling in data selection?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: How do discrete and continuous time models differ in their approach to time sampling? What advantages does each method offer in the context of active inference?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: Discuss the concept of "inhibition of return" in relation to time sampling. How does this concept inform the strategy for selecting data points over time?
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Evaluating the implications of information gain in the context of active inference.
    - Question 1: What is the relationship between information gain and the concept of mutual information in the context of active inference? How does this relationship influence decision-making?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Critically assess the notion that the value of information is always conditioned upon an ultimate goal. What are the implications for designing experiments that prioritize information gain?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: Explore how the expected free energy framework can be used to evaluate the balance between epistemic and pragmatic values in active data selection. Provide a detailed example to illustrate your point.
    - Answer 3: 

* Learning objective: Connecting active inference with machine learning paradigms.
    - Question 1: How can active data selection methods enhance the efficiency of machine learning models, particularly in the context of deep learning architectures?
    - Answer 1: 

    - Question 2: Discuss the potential challenges and limitations of integrating active inference principles with existing machine learning frameworks. What considerations should be made to address these challenges?
    - Answer 2: 

    - Question 3: In what ways can the active learning paradigm, as informed by active inference, lead to improved model performance in real-world applications? Provide specific examples.
