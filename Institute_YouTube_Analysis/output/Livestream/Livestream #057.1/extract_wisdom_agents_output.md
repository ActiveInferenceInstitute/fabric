QUOTES:
- "The idea is to take some of the same principles that we use in active inference."
- "Time is a really interesting issue in terms of how you model a lot of these sorts of processes."
- "The predictive entropy is a positive thing if I’m uncertain about what I’d see."
- "The key twist here is that we’re now not just interested in message passing for inference."
- "Conditional entropy essentially says if I were to sample over here, how confident am I?"
- "The figure shows an example where the ambiguity is actually the same everywhere."
- "The best models will always be the simplest you can get away with."
- "Precision can be applied to any probability distribution essentially."
- "The streetlight effect is originally set up to be something to describe an unhelpful bias."
- "The model might differ from that in the world but is also a much better model."
