In today’s session, we will engage with a new guest, Fraser, and revisit some topics from the previous discussion, along with any additional subjects that may arise. To begin, Fraser, would you like to introduce yourself and provide a recap or any thoughts you wish to discuss today?

Hello, everyone. My name is Fraser, and I hope you can hear me well. I am a recent graduate in computer science from the University of Western Australia. My primary interest lies in applying active inference to real-world scenarios, particularly in real-time processing. I am fascinated by how both biological and artificial organisms utilize active inference to develop an ecological niche that enhances their adaptability over time. While this is a broad statement, optimizing our data solicitation processes will enable us to achieve this goal more effectively than in the past.

I am particularly intrigued by the connection between the concepts presented in this paper and relevance realization, an emerging framework in cognitive science. There is significant potential for exploration in this area, so thank you for the opportunity to discuss it.

Thomas, what are your immediate thoughts regarding relevance realization and active inference? What would you like to explore further?

I would like to learn more about relevance realization and its implications, as I currently lack expertise in that area.

Excellent! I believe we can have an engaging dialogue. Fraser, how would you like to introduce this topic, and we can see where it leads us?

I must emphasize that relevance realization is an emerging framework, with several papers discussing it under that title in cognitive science. The central idea is that the ability to focus on relevant information constitutes cognition. As cognitive agents, we strive to become effective cognitive entities through active inference. The hypothesis posits that cognitive agents can identify the relevant information necessary for their survival and goal achievement, which is integral to their autopoiesis as organisms.

This raises the question: what does it mean to seek relevance in an environment? Traditionally, this involves avoiding detrimental stimuli and seeking beneficial ones. However, it is crucial to note that a universal theory of relevance does not exist; relevance is context-dependent. While certain elements may be relevant based on their size, lifespan, or reproductive strategy, nothing is canonically relevant in an absolute sense. What we can develop is a theory of relevance realization, which encompasses the processes, mechanisms, and trade-off relationships that facilitate the recognition of relevance.

Furthermore, the framework of relevance realization does not assume that relevance is merely detected in the environment or solely expressed from within our cognitive schemas. Instead, relevance is co-created through the dynamic interaction between the agent and its environment. These ideas align well with the broader active inference framework, making this an opportune moment to introduce this other perspective.

I apologize, Thomas, for bringing up a theory that may be new to you, but I believe our discussion will navigate similar themes that interest me. I hope this makes sense.

Absolutely! Thank you for your explanation. I am curious about the relationship between relevance realization and salience in psychology. Are they analogous, or does one encompass the other?

To my knowledge, relevance realization is closely related to predictive processing, particularly in how precision weighting is shared across processes underlying relevance realization. In this context, salience may be understood as a facet of relevance, but they are not identical. In summary, there is considerable overlap between the dynamics of self-organizing systems and the ontology of relevance realization, particularly regarding how precision weighting and predictive processing interrelate.

This raises an interesting point: Is there something intrinsic about relevance that necessitates action? Are my actions determined by relevance in a clear manner? One could envision an attentional system that merely weighs precision based on passive data streams to identify the most informative channels for belief updating, without actively altering any conditions. In contrast, salience implies a more active engagement, where I am actively choosing which data streams to prioritize.

In this schema, I would argue that relevance sits within the salience landscape. The emphasis here is on our adaptive interaction with the environment to solicit the right observations that are conducive to our agency. Would you mind elaborating on your definition of salience?

I find that attention functions as a form of control, determining the precision of various modalities available to me. This can manifest at different levels, whether through spatial channels or specific features. My distinction regarding salience is that it drives action; I perceive it in terms of the information gain associated with various actions. This raises the question of what constitutes an action. For example, I might overtly move my eyes toward something, but I can also "act" by allocating more precision to a particular channel without explicit movement.

Thus, the process involves weighing alternatives; the selection between actions depends on the precision attributed to different modalities. If something is perceived as more precise, it implies less ambiguity, thus allowing for greater information gain. This highlights the conflation of these concepts, as they interconnect in profound ways. It is beneficial to differentiate between the act of assigning precision and the process of selecting between alternatives to maximize information acquisition.

Yes, regarding information gain, we encounter the issue of which model to deploy for interpreting sensory errors and determining which observations warrant our attention. Historically, relevance realization has addressed model selection, focusing on how this framework can tackle the frame problem in psychology. When deploying a particular schema to dynamically self-organize around sensory prediction errors, we must consider how model selection fits into this framework.

In this regard, relevance realization can be seen as a form of covert action—an action not merely defined by physical movement but by the cognitive selection of models and their deployment.

Yes, that aligns with the idea that the action involves selecting a model, thus representing a form of cognitive action. This perspective is crucial, especially concerning model selection as applied within machine learning contexts.

I find this perspective valuable in our ongoing discussions about the importance of data selection and the associated actions. It prompts us to consider why certain actions are vital. One reason may be efficiency; selecting specific data portions reduces the need to process everything simultaneously. This rationale underpins our design choices in clinical trials and other research settings.

Returning to the notion of salience, I recall the classic dichotomy of dissipating free energy through either changing the mind or changing the world. In terms of modifying the world, we must consider which data streams to sample, akin to eye movement, while changing the mind entails navigating the inner salience landscape and relevance realization, enabling a degree of freedom in selecting models that provide epistemic value.

What is the pragmatic counterpart to salience in this context? Is it the expected utility associated with an action?

That is an intriguing question, as it touches on various terminologies that may convey similar meanings. Expected utility, expected reward, and negative cost are all terms that describe something's attractiveness or aversiveness. Even this characterization can be somewhat tautological, as it essentially states that behavior is influenced by attractive or aversive stimuli, defined in relation to the actions they elicit.

This consideration relates to the partitioning of pragmatic and epistemic value in active inference. If we were to adopt a purely cost-based data sampling approach—contrasting with the methodology presented in this paper—we could incorporate various epistemic features, such as novelty. However, this would ultimately yield a monolithic cost-based objective. Conversely, the approach in this paper initiates with cost-free epistemic elements of information gain, allowing for a clearer distinction between costs and epistemic benefits.

It is fascinating to explore these divergent strands of thought. Active inference and the framework we delineated may converge with long-established theories, such as expected utility theory and reinforcement learning. These approaches have increasingly incorporated information gain into their cost functions. Additionally, optimal experimental design has emerged as a significant focus, emphasizing the need to efficiently design experiments and conduct feature selection to maximize inference.

In this context, how can we optimize our decision-making in clinical trials or other research settings? What key parameters should we consider to assess their effects on the information gained and the preferences associated with different outcomes? In principle, any of these parameters can be systematically analyzed, offering opportunities to optimize decision-making processes.

As we consider the implications of sophisticated inference schemes, it is essential to acknowledge the computational costs involved. However, when the situation allows for it, sophisticated inference can provide valuable insights into how to best sample data and optimize decision-making.

Thank you for the engaging discussion today, Fraser and Thomas. Your insights have been invaluable, and I look forward to our next conversation.
