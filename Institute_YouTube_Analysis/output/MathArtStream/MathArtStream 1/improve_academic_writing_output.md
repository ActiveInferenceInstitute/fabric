**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome. We are here for the inaugural session of "Math Art Conversations." It is May 17, 2024, and we are excited to embark on this new series and journey together. I will now pass the floor to Shana to commence the discussion.

Thank you, Daniel, for hosting us. We are here to introduce what we term "Math Art Conversations." We have several objectives, one of which is to explore the active inference formalism to identify what we perceive as universal connections between mathematics and the arts. I have always been intrigued by questions regarding the intersection of mathematical and artistic thinking, particularly the conditions under which mathematical thought transitions into artistic expression, and vice versa. For us, "math art" is a singular concept, akin to a form of synesthesia, and we aim to elucidate the conditions that unify these disciplines.

Our mission is to illuminate the relationship between mathematics and the arts, highlighting the profound connections between active inference, mathematics, and artistic expression. In pursuing this, we intend to amplify the diversity of mathematical and artistic thinking by engaging with key concepts across disciplines. 

There are multiple ways to access these fields. While schematization serves as one avenue into mathematics, wonder represents another. We wish to approach these subjects through the lens of wonder. The themes I am particularly interested in exploring include illumination, vision (specifically categorical sight), and the concept of the Looking Glass. In terms of illumination, we seek to investigate universal constructions that bridge mathematics and the arts. Regarding vision, we are interested in new modes of seeing. I have long been captivated by the notion of neurons that can perceive; how does this occur? In this context, categorical theory manifests through representable functors, which we will also discuss.

Additionally, we are keen on conducting in-depth explorations of various artists and mathematicians who carve their own unique paths, often producing prolific and voluminous work in the form of epistolary letters. These letters, directed towards no specific recipient, provoke questions about the nature of communication and the essence of artistic expression. The Looking Glass metaphor serves as an homage to Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking Glass," emphasizing that appearances can be deceptive. The unicorn's famous declaration, "Now that we have seen each other, if you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you," resonates with me deeply.

In one of my recent poems, "Diamond," I played with language to explore the tension between external grandeur and internal despair. The dual reflections presented in category theory, such as universality and terminality, reveal how one's subjective experience can be both confining and liberating. We intend to navigate these intricate concepts, using language and imagery as tools for exploration.

Hector will now share his insights.

Thank you, Daniel, and thank you, Shana, for initiating these conversations. I would like to build on some points Shana made. This series is somewhat unconventional, as we aim to intertwine what are often perceived as separate domains: the arts, sciences, and mathematics. I am reminded of W. S. Merwin's poem "Oh Me, Oh Life," which speaks to the struggle for meaning amidst a sense of emptiness. The poem ultimately conveys hope by affirming one's existence and identity within the powerful play of life. This resonates with our intention to contribute meaningfully, albeit humbly, to the discourse.

We seek to add value through the application of active inference, a relatively new paradigm that provides fresh tools for engaging with the arts. We aim to explore curiosity, surprise, and the interplay between exploitation and exploration within artistic contexts. Conversely, we wish to examine whether the arts can elucidate mathematical and scientific concepts. This inquiry invites us to consider whether engaging with art can yield novel insights into mathematics and science.

Returning to the Looking Glass metaphor, I propose that we attempt to perceive the world from the opposite side, reflecting on how this perspective can enrich our understanding. 

I will now pass the conversation back to Daniel to continue our exploration.

Thank you both for your thought-provoking introductions. The Looking Glass and the myriad ways we can approach active investigation into mathematics and art suggest that these disciplines may not be as disparate as they seem. We might consider whether we look through a telescope or a microscope in our inquiry, navigating the complexities of these interconnected fields.

Shana, would you like to share some thoughts on what lies ahead in our discussions?

Certainly! Hector and I have compiled an exciting list of topics for future streams. We plan to delve into the works of various artists, including William Blake, Wassily Kandinsky, and the Romantic poets such as Byron and Mary Shelley. One particular text we aim to explore is Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol." Dickens's narrative is rich with complexity, particularly in the scenes where Scrooge interacts with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. 

One scene stands out, where Scrooge observes his former lover, Belle, and her husband. The haunting nature of the past is palpable, as Scrooge expresses his desire to be removed from the painful memories. This evokes profound questions about the mathematics of memory, identity, and how our past influences our present and future.

We intend to center our discussions on the human experience, exploring themes of memory, longing, and regret. We are excited to engage with these powerful concepts through a variety of artistic lenses, demonstrating that mathematics is anything but anesthetic.

Hector, do you have another example to share?

Yes, I would like to revisit the idea of using art to explain concepts typically addressed through scientific frameworks. Umberto Eco, renowned for his literary works, offers profound insights in "The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana," where the protagonist grapples with memory loss. In a poignant passage, he reflects on the relationship between memory and identity, emphasizing that our understanding of the future is intricately tied to our recollections of the past. This exploration of memory invites us to consider how we can connect literature, poetry, and mathematics to unveil deeper meanings.

Thank you for sharing that, Hector. I find it fascinating how explanations can both close gaps in understanding and open avenues for further curiosity. Art often prompts questions, while science seeks answers. We must explore how these disciplines enrich one another rather than create divisions.

In closing, I invite everyone to join us on this journey as we explore the intersections of mathematics, art, and science. We aim to externalize and examine the intricacies of our internal experiences, navigating through the Looking Glass of our understanding.
