hello and welcome we are here in math art conversations number one it's May 17th 2024 this is kicking off a new series and a New Journey and adventure for us so we're looking forward to this conversation and series I'll pass to shanana to begin thank you so much Daniel for having us so uh we are here to introduce what we're calling math art conversations so uh we have many goals one of them is that we are curious and interested in using the active inference formalism to construct what we see is universal connections between mathematics and the Arts um I know I've always been interested in these questions like when does mathematical thinking become artistic thinking and and vice versa so for us math art is one word and so we really want to figure out what are the conditions to have math art being one word almost like a synesthesia so um our mission is going to be to illuminate math art and highlight these profound connections between active inference mathematics and the Arts and then so doing this we really want to amplify the variations in mathematical and artistic Thinking by working kind of major Concepts um cross disciplinarily so I'll just say a little bit and I know Hector will say a little bit as well so there's you know multiple ways of accessing these fields and so yes schematization is one way to interner mathematics but wonder is another and so we want to approach some of these things through Wonder so some of the thematics that I'm interested in exploring are um illumination site so visual SI ght as categorical site s te uh and the Looking Glass so for illumination we're interested in these Universal constructions between mathematics and the artarts um for site we're interested in New of seeing I remember I've always been Enchanted by um I'm sorry I'm sorry what neurons that can see how does that happen um and so side and category Theory takes the form of representable functors and so um we'll talk about that as well well we're also interested in doing these deep dives into various artists and mathematicians um that sort of go on their own path almost very Sigma likee and um they start writing these their work becomes um prodigious and voluminous but it takes the form kind of of epistolary letters and these like these letters to no one and like what is the sight of a letter and the sight of a letter to No One the sight of a poem what does this mean so the Looking Glass line is um obviously um an homage to carols Through the Looking Glass and they're like things are not always what they seem and so uh the unicorn um you know famously says I always thought children were fabulous monsters and uh unicorn famously as well now that we have seen each other if you'll believe in me I'll believe in you is it a bargain and um I've always been Enchanted by that so there's Looking Glass cake that I wrote a an idea about like having a stack a category the version of Looking Glass cake and so um in Looking Glass land you know things are sort of backwards and so uh to serve the cake you have to P it round first and then cut it and um Alice is having um problems with this and the lion goes what a Time the monster is cutting up that cake and there's a little unicorn here as well this way all right so um in my uh one of my recent poems Diamond we'll talk about when we talk about math poetry um I had this play of language like topos Tiger's dream of Looking Glass ice cream so I was trying to explore like uh the narrator in this work can experience the shimmering grandeur the diamond if she's on the outside but she can experience The Haunting despair about being trapped in your own internal reflection so category theory has these powerful concepts of uh you know universality and terminality and so I wrote this kind of in this confessional style to capture these dual Reflections like being trapped inside your own thoughts but being a terminal object by universality there's nowhere non- terminal to go and so I thought that was actually really powerful that an access point into C ategory Theory could just be your own feeling State and so there these like thick lines of tension going on in the play toost tigers um Looking Glass ice cream Black Rainbows things like that so we're going to play around with this like looking glass site and the grth and deque site right you know because um as moonchild says you know Beginnings are always dark so Hector's going to call us sort of like the bars of math art and I can't wait to see how Hector says that that new thinking kind of proceedes by storytelling um the storytelling of mathematics in the art storytelling as you know free energy principle so for the scaffolding what we want to do is take um you know certain ideas like mystery or curiosity or imagination analyze it from this sort of three-dimensional perspective like free energy principle mathematics and the Arts so perhaps mystery according to a free energy principle would be this play of entropy and affordance and this wickedness of complexity and then math might approach it from con concept building like how strange or the ptic numbers and then you know art might take it through you know the site of our Gothic Heroes like Gothic fantasy haunted summer Return to Oz osma in the mirror like where is osma you know where is the side of these mirrors you know so we have this sort of TR dimensional interdisciplinary grasp on these Concepts and so we just hope that it illuminates um the universalities you know at play and so we hope that um at the end of every uh stream we hope to offer something engaging like an invitation to actively infer and participate because as one of our great colleagues Dean you know and you you know have also have always asked like what does it mean to be an active infer so that together we have a mathart is like a a virtuous circle so I'll pass it over to Hector you okay thank you Daniel thank you Shana thank you for hosting these conversations um I will pick up on some things that Shana said um when they was thinking how to in this series which are a bit crazy because we want to mix up things that seem to be um separated from each other Arts and Sciences and maths so I thought in the poem by W Wiman oh me your life which is one of my favorites and he is talking about someone who is struggling to find meaning in life and he's ring for with other people that is also struggling whose lives are pointless um empty useless and so it it seems there is no hope but at the end he provides some Hope by saying something like uh you are here you have identity life exist the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a first I think that's beautifully put because it offers us a way out and we everybody can contribute diverse to the powerful play which is life right and in this case I think we might contribute diverse which is something humble we don't pretend to change the world but maybe we can contribute the birth by offering New Perspective so we might add something of value that's what I was thinking that how can we add value when so many brighter Minds have already tackled Arts from the point of view of maths and Sciences and see I see here two different Avenues one is the one that Shan already pointed which is applying activ inference so because active inference is a more or less new paradigm it offers us new tools to approach the art and this can be the straightforward way to go active inference to explain Arts we can play with curiosity with surprisal with exploitation exploration and there is another way which is more bold it's Bolder which is um taking science and maths and explain it through the glass of the Arts so it would be like what Lis carols did right so now it's not that we try to do what so many people have attempted before which is try to find numbers in the art like the golden radio proportion or to make to fit some numerical pattern to a musical piece that's not what we want to attempt here or at least that's not all so we might try to do the reverse is it possible that Arts can help us explain maths and Sciences so this is this is a question I think we need to explore that so is it possible that if we look at science through Arts we can find new meaning is that even possible and coming back to the things that sik and that Looking Glass metaphor which is so powerful I was thinking that metaphor Al it might be like we normally watch the image of ourself in the mirror how would be the world from the mirror outside so that's what we would like to try here right metaphorically to watch from the other side and and I pass it that to Daniel because otherwise I will digress digress too much thank you both very intriguing intro logs I think the Looking Glass and the site also the cite the citations and all the different ways that that scenario of the active investigation whether we think math and art or science and art are on two sides communicating through aasian lens or whether technique or apparatus or science is the lens itself bringing us to the question of our strategy about whether we look through the telescope or the the microscope at a given moment those are kind of the explosions that are happening and sometimes to to linearize them and to make them concrete if they should even be made concrete is where we find ourselves having such Delight so I'm very appreciative that that both of you and many others have brought all of this energy to play because for very long I've seen the possibility ities of that two-way street with math and art and now it's like we barely need a street with uh the deletion of the space in between and Every Act of scientific communication textual figures code math those have an aesthetic elements and aesthetic communication and experience has Technical and formalizable elements as well so they are so in mesed and they're so richly intertwined that with new and multiple perspectives who knows where that could go do you want to share Shana anything or give some thoughts on like what will be coming up uh yeah that'd be great so Hector and I preparing um sort of just a you know a list of amazing topics we want to explore so some math streams to come will be like I said these deep dives into various artists um Blake Kandinsky uh our haunted summer Heroes Byron Shelly Mary Shelly um uh poets Dickens um one that we want to start with um is dickens's A Christmas Carol so um it is undeniable how powerful of a writer Dickens is and he always has so many things going on um specifically one part of A Christmas Carol um Hector and I really were drawn to so as we know Scrooge is visited by you know the Ghost of Christmas Past present and future these each become more and more kind of Haunting as they proceed um and Scrooge wakes up kind of in proportion as their haunting this and so there's this one scene um where the Ghost of Christmas Past visits Scrooge and um so Scrooge is watching a scene take place Belle's husband sees Scrooge and he's says that Scrooge looks quite alone in the world I do believe Scrooge says Spirit remove me from this place the Ghost says I told you that these were Shadows of the things that have been that they are what they are do not blame me Scrooge says Le me take me back haunt me no longer and try as he may Scrooge could cannot extinguish the light of the ghost so the ghost of christas house has this very prominent cap and Scrooge tries to extinguish um use the cap to extinguish the light that is burning from the ghost head and he can't the light just sort of diffuses everywhere so tries he may he can't and so I was I've always been fascinated by like kind of investigating like what's the mathematics at play here um what's the mathematics of having these of having these ghosts visit um and Scrooge is able to walk around through apparitions Jacob Marley can actually talk to um Scrooge and these others cannot right the the Ghost says they are what they are do not blame me you cannot interact with them and so you know the mathematics of that line these are the shadows of things that have been I think it's very powerful there you could possibly interpret that as like many worlds um there seems to be some you know like in terms of affordances what does that mean to be visited by these kinds of ghosts so for many of us these ghosts are in our own mind and I think that's very powerful uh that you can transport right that you can imagine and so um you know to be visited and then to have these sort of you know they also it seems like the ghosts also take this sort of epistolary form because they're always leaving these these notes and Scrooge wakes up time still seems to be the same yet he has traveled so I always thought that was cool um so you know the you know we're centering on like The Human Experience and what it actually means to have an experience why do you experience memories things like this um because we would give anything to be able to go back and change something right and so what is that and so we want to touch on these powerful concepts of like longing regret reflection through these um you know what seems to be kind of anesthetic means but I think the you know mathematics is anything but like anesthetic you know like looking glass ice cream what does that taste like what what color is that you know um and Hector now you have um another example yeah thanks Shah um I was thinking um coming back to what I said before uh we want to use the Arts to explain things that have been explained from a scientific scientific point of view and I remember also a passage from Umberto eeko which everybody will will know because of the name of the Rose is the writer of the name of the Rose and I I love this writer so I read mostly everything he he has I've read everything he had written basically and there is one book which is very nice from 2004 I think to remember which is the mysterious flame of Queen Lana and it's about one guy which was a retired owner of a a book of antique book shop something like that so he has a stroke and loses memory completely so he cannot remember any anything nor even her wife and there is a passage of this book that is something this guy is is thinking about and and I think it it tells a lot about how we can connect memory with time with self and that's what I think we might try here also now we have a writer offering a different view which is profound interesting and I think it gives I mean it's not something entirely new but the way he approach it I think it's very useful and interesting and I I want to read it because otherwise I will mess up so if you allow me I just read the piece and you will see how in how nice and profound it is so this is the protagonist the one that has lost the memory so he says I was dosing and the clock woke me I didn't hear the first few times this L that is to say I didn't count them but as soon as I decided to count I realized that there had already been three so I was able to count four five and so on I understood that I could say four and then wait for the fifth because one two and three had passed and I somehow knew that if the fourth time had been the first I was conscious of I would have thought it was 6:00 I think our life are like that you can only anticipate the future if you can call the past to mind I cannot count the times of my life because I don't know how many came before on the other hand I dosed off because the chair had been rocking for a while and I do off in a certain moment because that moment had been preceded by other moments and because I was relaxing while awaiting the subsequent moment but if the first moments hadn't put me in the right frame of mind if I had begun rocking in any other moment I wouldn't have expected what had to come I would have remained awake you need memory even to fall asle asleep or no I think this is beautiful because it's so profound like my current self is explained by my past self so if you lose your past You Lose Yourself partially so it's like how you make sense of the future has a lot to do how how you can re-experience the past so this is the things I would like to explore from writers poets it's there is a profound message that I think it's it's even also it's nice so I think it's this is the approach we could take here perhaps to offer some kind of literature poetry but stuct the profound meaning behind okay and I pass you I pass it to you guys um thank you both I'll make a point about explanation and then invoke a few little other artistic pieces so when you mentioned Hector about art being used to explain that made me wonder whether explanations address and close our uncertainties and in what ways they open up our Curiosities and one way of looking at math and Art and Science would be like artly us with questions what did the painter mean what does this mean and science addresses answers I mean this binds to that and we slam the door shut on the peer review at the same time we have art that addresses and does provide a period at the end of a sentence and we have of course scientific inquiry that opens up questions as well so they both perhaps again two sides of the same three-sided coin they both have this element of of diminishing and expanding and transmuting our Curiosities so can we stick with that ineffable curiosity that enlivens both rather than try to pit these disciplines or techniques against each other and then um two works of art that I'll just briefly mention first to the ghost reference from Christmas Carol that made me think of the ghost in Hamlet and how complex of a character the ghost plays in the play and over the hundreds of years how many interpretations it has spurred running the gamut of just every physical metaphysical speculation and how the work becomes part of identity through time um then to the Umberto eeko I'll read one quote from fuko's pendulum so it's a dialogue between two individuals oh here's a few I will now show you this text forgive me for using a photocopy it's not distrust I don't want to subject the original to further wear but ingolf's copy wasn't the original I said the parchment was the original casabon when Originals no longer exist the last copy is the original I mean umber is amazing I mean he was an academic also but he wasn't a scholar I mean but still I mean he's so profound awesome um okay shanon what are you thinking or where do you want to go from here well first I want yeah before I I end this I want to ask everybody's question what do you think um Echo means right when he says you need memory to fall asleep that's interesting that's the most um kind of abstract part of it um [Music] um I guess it means that I mean that's an interpretation but I don't know if you agree I think he's talking about making again making sense of your own life so to make sense of your own life or anything in the future related to yourself you need to be aware of what you were before but maybe I'm project projecting here but the thing is like many things you yes can make sense if you can remember and especially when it comes to yourself I was thinking when I came by the car I mean before was just thinking what do it happen if I lo lose completely my memory what if I think was I a good person I'm am I evil imagine you cannot remember anything because now I can think of instances of what I did before and I can figure figure out whether I'm good or not or I have some moral standards or not but imagine you cannot remember anything how are you to tell who you are so that's the kind of thing I see in this passage from Umberto EO how important it is to remember your personal past to even figure out who you really are so it's so it must be so tremendous to lose completely your past like that I mean I cannot even imagine how I mean how shocking that must be for someone I I would also add that I is a self reference that invokes experience and also memory and narrative history and that's something we see reflected in active inference as well so I cannot sleep because without memory there wouldn't be I to sleep however in the moment of falling asleep we have a change or a softening of something because we don't remember necessarily so there's like a handoff and we can take pictures of the brain while the handoff is happening has that reduced the mystery of sleep even a little no wow there's so many connection with that so many things I mean with Shana we were discussing with her idea of that Consciousness right so when you live your conscious awareness is different but I was telling Shana the funny thing is that you do not know you are asleep you don't say I'm in a dream because you are afraid if something bad happening but you never forget it is you so you and your dream still feel you even though you cannot tell reality from dreams and that's there are so many funny things in dreams that are interesting yeah yeah so that's I definitely want to we'll do a deep dive into the dream state hence my sleep is the Proto State I swear it is as many you know Sleep Disorders as I have I thought in periods of great creativity you're likely not sleeping and it might be because Daniel's saying you're in the softening of the identity um we'll also do um so some things coming up we'll be talking about cre meaning making right what what what is that uh whose Markoff blanket do you actually start with um um Clive wearing is a another wonderful person that I I brought up before famous a concert pianist who got a a retrograde amnesia and then like Hector was saying um can possibly relate to Roberto Eko because um he lost personal memory but not motor memory and so uh he has about a six-second memory something like this you can see so many good interviews with him on on YouTube and BBC and um I was always perplex because you know he he's he's known for saying you know home is yesterday thought five doesn't even have a yesterday you know but he's orienting like a sense of identity and like temporally you know where normally you would say my home is in Pasadena or something like that so um I'm so excited we have so many things to talk about and then um yeah so we'll also be playing around in the fourth dimension I have great colleague and I who you know said maybe the fourth dimensional coordinate is actually the play between inside outside so you can have a 4D system and slowly delicately change that fourth-dimensional coordinate and imagine the possibilities and we'll just sort of keep going Imagining the fifth so we have lots of things to play around with and you know we just really hope that um if anyone wants to have these conversations we seem to be externalizing some things that are deeply internal and we want to have those conversations as well um you know albe it in in mirrors but yeah dreams alone and taking photos of the brain the brain itself seems to be highly looking glass right so yeah um yeah so um and then we'll shift over to like literature so at least you have playing around the fourth dimension deep Dives dream state dark Imaginarium dark Consciousness and then Hector I also so want to do um a a sort of playing around with Sonic architectural and affordance and category Theory so that I say something like the yita limma and you would be able to compose something based on that you know what are the immediate social dimensions of the UN you might be able to see them in kard and so you think UN in kard how do you get that and so we think through active inference you can get that and all that's enough for now would you like me to read some of the questions and comments from the chat and we'll just do like a little lightning round yeah that' be great great yes okay I'll just read some feel free to give any short thoughts or or pass okay Dean asks does category Theory capture or release imagination oh that's great that's well yeah I think it uh what so beautiful that you know you're like it's my tree I've had this tree forever and then in category Theory you just have the set of trees and then you can realize that other people have trees and you can make higher Maps between those things so I think uh I think category theory was made to be Visionary and to release um to release imagination and it's also beautiful in the fact that it's a it's all about sight right the maps out of this object is what that object sees right and then I can go higher than that and then I can have Maps between Maps so you're building up these higher levels of inferences and I think there's you know inference is is Imagination so your your category Theory allows you to have not just linear imagination but two imagination three imagination four and so I think category theory is there to help let that imagination be even like more released you know yeah no capturing okay I'll add if if you're throwing out and releasing those fast balls then category Theory helps me catch the syntax and the conceptual structures not to catch and Destroy but to catch and release again and to latch and unlatch and pin and unpin and then the way that it can capture a stroke but not again not to capture and Destroy But but so that it can be a platform even for an instant that's jumped off of again okay another question from Dean can we put the spectral I.E rainbow back into its energy source is it a looking lens or a looking spectrum that might reveal the math art dependency wow he you want to take that one no I think that one is for you because those are category and that sounds very like sha I I think it's Daniel it's rainbow yeah the thing about rainbows Dean that I find very perplexing is that where do they exist so they seem to be this um geometric alignment and my rainbow is never your Rainbow right so it's very particular on the eye very particular on the eye the I and the I and so um I think uh you know it's interesting you say that because I'm trying to figure out like uh if pink was a category right imagine pink was a category or pink was a two category what would be the objects what are the one morphisms what are the two morphisms and so Dean like uh I my world has very much exploded trying to think of color in terms of um universality so I think that um I think that rainbow through um through categories like I think category theory is going to give a permanence to the rainbow that it wouldn't have ordinarily and so um I mean you know you have these super numery rainbows and I mean imagine you had a like dark rainbows so I think through the categorical formalism you can actually um get something like that um yeah and so can you put the Spectrum back yeah well I I think you you can make like um I think the Spectrum can become I want to say that um like no longer linear and it wraps around itself you're used to electromagnetic spectrum like stopping and stopping but imagine the color schematic like uh was non-orientable something like a mobia strip I don't know I think through category Theory like Daniel was saying you can get enough structure to make color something else so I think through something like a rainbow that you could give human creatures like us um who just have three that has 12 cones so I think because we're not able to do that but you can using category Theory you can actually get a 12 chromatic Vision okay like the rain the mantis shrimp rainbow I can't even imagine like what that that was too long but okay I'll go with a question from question from Steven cette he wrote past present and future ghosts UPS the anti in story trajectories what has happened is one level of stake the present is more vital and sets up expectations going to the Future UPS the stakes more I like it yeah people talk about they talk about the ghost they have seen the ghost they are seeing what is the status of a ghost that you expect to [Music] see Hector you want to take that I mean I don't I'm not sure if I understood the the question but um I'm thinking evolutionary terms that probably most of what we experience in the past prepare us for the future so there is this Preparatory um continuous preparation for what what is to come so I guess what you expect is very important and you are always preparing for that but you need some priors and that's where the cost of the past prepare you for the cost of the future so I mean in general I think that your personal past and your projected self in the future are two side of the same coin and one prepar it for for the other so I that it doesn't matter if you bring yourself personally to your past or to project yourself to the future I don't see big differences in this um in terms of what your cognition does one I mean imagine I go to my past and I I remember I recall a very bad experience that has been triggered by one stimulus in my present okay so I see something that I have associated with a bad memory personal memory so I go to the past I project myself to the past I recall that scene that happening and then I exract valuable information I project it to the Future so I project myself to the Future using that information and I prepare myself to react to the stimuli so I see like that I think is so interconnected I don't even know if I answer the question but that's my take on this multiplicity of also I think from the predictive processing active inference just focusing on vision and sight here what we're experiencing in the moment is consequence of projections from the recent past and it also brings together multimodal integration with other senses in the near future and that's kind of like the thickness of the now through modalities which are categorically disperate and also has all of these other metaphors of flow directionality movement shape place that aren't literally to be found in the stopwatch and so what's not there in the stopwatch but is there in our uh in the res resonance with our experience that is a direction to pursue the human components of time yeah oh and Stephen yeah also want to make a note to the so the Fantasia a Fantasia Spectrum where I find myself on the very on the A on the Fantasia spectrum of things that uh the just the the shape in which you store things I think is going to have everything to do with your capacity for expectation right so uh there's some of us that could stay in a room forever because your imaginary space is just as real so for some like imagination is real so for the the you know the a fantasic that might be like a a complete nightmare right but for the you know the fantasic then you only have expectations so when we say like increasing the stakes I think that or other people that identify with me like that you're always in the ghost of future because all you have is expectation the the real is so quick but you're moving so quick so I think um there's a speed at play here as well so what is the speed of time and you know things like that but I I do think that spectrum is sort of underrepresented and that you know the way you store things like Hector's think thinks that some of my memories are stored as do now right so right how what's what is that do now do now that I can just oh they're just in my living room right over here so that the distance that you're perceiving between things I think your relationship to the distance the distance of a memory um is something very curious to me because if you're in the ptic world which I think are far more fundamental numbers what was you know what was thought of as being like a far distance is actually very close so these numbers the notion of distance and so I think your relationship to those points um yeah um is is probably what what what makes your condition for expectation such a good question okay I'll do one more reading from the chat and then then that'll be great okay so first just to Define land hour's principle is a physical principle pertaining to the lower theoretical limit of energy consumption of computation Jeff asked what does Land hours principle mean to the conversation about rainbows being observed by multiple agents and shared perception SL perspective Dan you want to take that I think yeah that's okay if if we take rainbow to be not merely a phenomena out there if we take what shenana said that rainbow it is I dependent it's Vision sight dependence if you just have water droplets and sunshine you don't have a rainbow as experienced so if we take rainbow to include an active cognitive then we could ask questions like how much energy does it take to produce a rainbow I love that yeah the unit it could actually be a um a unit of thought right the the lower threshold to produce a cognitive experience that is a rainbow and what happens in what happens if you're not quite there yet right who's rainbow is it a rainbow that's just unexperienced wow another piece would be poem as rainbow if you just have a sequence of words on the page that's like the water droplets in the air but if poem or poetry requires recipient even if it's the same at a different time then we can explore the categories and the types of things that are only what they are in the interaction which dissolves the idea that that could be made objective and also that that makes me think that um the fact that we resonate with the Arts uh it doesn't matter I mean if you are from USA from Spain Italy uh we try to convert in the appreciation of the art which makes me think that that means that we have form similar generative models and at some some extent we can give a similar meaning which I mean just the C to me that that we make sense of this art and have this appreciation that is not I mean it's there is a part that is called but still there are things that move everybody so maybe that means our generative models align somehow or I mean you can talk of that perception as some preferences as a human beings but still maybe there is something also with the generative model that makes explains this piece of art I don't know that makes any sense yeah Daniel I want to ask just one thing jumping up just very great question would you uh would you and Hector help me just kind of play with a do you see any connection between this fundamental limit of computation or information gathering and what Hector says is the profound human ability to transport yourself right Hector how did you say it that it's you studied with you know non-human animals and things and that it seems to be the human that can actually transport your yourself to um how did you say it and I wonder if there's any connection between that ability and this fundamental yes yes you can project yourself but that's I think that's I mean there are many things that we have developed um importantly like contrafactual and I think this is not unrelated so you can um imag imine many alternative scenarios all the time and I think that has to do with this ability to project yourself back and forth so you can imagine what would have happened had I taken the road or left home five minutes before if you had an car CR for instance so I think this is all related is this ability to entertain multiple potential simultaneous possibilities and I think our hierarchical mechanistic mind is marvelous and is very powerful to produce this kind of multiple Alternatives and you are juggling with that all the time so I think that's all serve the same purpose being able to anticipate if you will to reduce your price to have you are always and this is something we discussed it's a b speculative still but in to copy not to copy the paper I publish with Michael Walker um we thought that the fact that we can entertain multiple possibilities some how reduces um surprisal or because you can imagine things you have not even encountered yet you have this ability to imagine so if you can imagine something maybe if you ever encounter it it will be less surprising so I think this is very powerful mechanism well there is of course the classic Allison Wonderland quote sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast but so good but if you've believed if you've entertained six counterfactuals that could or couldn't have happened depending on your understanding of possibility causality Etc then have you not already entered Through the Looking Glass yeah that's that's the thing that if you have think you have thought of six POS ities probably you have thought of six alternative to that you know because I think it often goes with Pur right you think one or the other so maybe should I wear this or that should I take this or that so maybe there is always a black side whoever you want to call to anything you decide world but I think that's that's something we do all the time considering the possibilities you don't take the decisions you don't make so it's like you just not consider what you do what you think what you want to attempt you think of what what you don't attempt so what do happen you know what I mean so it's like you're always contemplating not only what you want to do or do but what you could or might do and I think that's that's very interesting just think hence the Everett phone you know to to be able to connect in many worlds and things like that Hello Operator um well some of the upcoming activities will be live streamed others will be recorded and then premiered also there's a lot of fun and activities on the edges and things that won't make their way to the YouTubes so any last words for this number one I want to say yeah if you want to come and play I think we've had a laid the foundation for many things that can grow and it's like looking glass seems to be everywhere and nowhere but never what it is yes yeah
