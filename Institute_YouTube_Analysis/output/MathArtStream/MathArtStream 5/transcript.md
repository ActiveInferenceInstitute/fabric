hello greetings thank you for joining everyone this is math art Stream 5 on July 26 2024 it's going to be a ride so first to shanana and please take it away thank you thank you so much Daniel for having us right we're excited everybody for the stream today we're going to be doing a part two of the visualizing the spatial Dimensions that Gem and I were talking about a couple weeks ago so we're going to go into the Fifth Dimension and we also have some surprises today so we hope you like the stream and I will just say Jim it's up to you thank you sha so let me start with um a little recap so um last time um we talked a little bit about the First Dimension in the inside outside coordinate system and that um we say that in a fourth dimension space there is two access system one represent the inside and one represent the outside surface so um to kind of get along with um further with that idea we kind of um explored um further on what perspective will be like in the First Dimension and I'll be talking about that today so you know like a little bit of recap already know in 1D system you know your perspective kind of originated from the point and that's it there is really no you know perspective projection or path in that system but once you get into a 2d system you know now you know your perspective originated from a point and now it have like a little bit of depths which is like a ray and um so but it still is a line so what it is only when you get into the 3D system where you have more freedom with the perspective whereas it still originate from a point but now you have like array and range so that you have that you know field of pictures of 2D so you have like a field of view and you have depths but um so in 4D system what would that perspective be like so if we use induction then the logical step will be that you know the origin the perspective origin now probably would become something like a line because that's the next log logical thing to do and so what would that look like what does that mean um that might mean you know your perspective now originate from every single point on that line and what would the perspective pass be like um so in order to kind of understand that um right now on this illustration um I just try to represent it as originate from a point still but um here is only to just try to wrap around the idea of how would a perspective in that space works so the um the X Y and Z axis of each of the two AIS system would kind of distort and wrap around this origin point and since you have a line that is um kind of or your perspective originated on that means you know um at each point of the line you can see every single coordinate on that um whole axis on all three of the axis and that's kind of important on getting to the next point which is um it is possible that you know Ford system the perspective pass is kind of like a volume instead of array and range So within that volume it is where um the perspective would work differently as you know for example um something outside that volume so you know you are looking inward on that volume and you're also looking outward from that volume so um to better represent this just um you know 2D way is imagine this uh the thicker circular line is the uh origin for the perspective now you're kind of looking both way um which is inward um and outward so imagine that circle like a volume of space so um I think the the easier to way to understand this is to understand the perspective itself as a entirely uh individual 3D system and it behaves the way a 3D system will work just like you know you know a 3D physical system our um Vision or our perspective is kind of 2D a stack of 2D so um this is essentially a 3D system stacked inside a 4D physical space and what like how it works is that you know um you you have this um perspective I I call it like Horizon which is the originator that uh You observe to the inside which is inward perspective to the um inside coordinate system and the other direction will be to the outside coordinate system so the outside AIS and that um if we try to imagine what the visualization looks like like the visualization kind of T around that um originator and that everything you know at each every single point on that line you'll be able to see um every single point on that allward perspective as well as the inward perspective and a better way to understand this is like um a 3D illustration of this this reanon so um since is a it behave like a 3D system I think there's like additional variable inside it that allows uh like allow a 40 creature to um control this perspective um you know right now we have a way in the 3D system to you know rotate our like array of Wheels you know rotate up down sideways but um the additional Ables inside the 4D system of the retina will be to um enlarge and Shrink this volume so essentially um imagine this black line you know this whole black line represents the outer diameter of the sphere and that um basically um you have this you know small volume that is kind of occupying um so imagine this big blue thing is the red now but now it's only this big like the black line imagine that's the red n and you're looking inward um the dark blue I represent as the inward perspective which is towards the inside cor and just try to imagine the outside white space as um the our perspective and that you know with a smaller volume you have a smaller degree of Arc so um basically all your um missions will be more concentrated so everything will be all CR up um and less distorted because everything is crammed together but as you move that um diameter bigger so your rum become bigger then your image uh you have a more degrees of Arc and that your image will be become more distorted so that would also work the same as you look outwards which I try to represent as the green you know U when you increase the diameter the imagery also you know become you know um more distorted so that's kind of the idea of how a volume of stive Works in that area so if we take what we know like right now and we go one step further um just as a concept then once you get to the 5D system um the crazy things start to happen so if we assume that there's two access system in the 40 there may very well be um four variables inside a 5D system so essentially you get four different outputs from a single 3D input uh in the 5D system instead of two in the 4D system so um in 5D system um if we use induction then you know ass assuming um the or origin now will become like a volume and that the perspective projection will start to do some crazy things so um so what what do I mean by four variables in a 5D system so in the middle here I um that's what we talk about the 4D system um the inside perspective AIS and the outside perspective AIS so now um I'm thinking about what would be two variables that represent this system and two variables that represent this system and um right now um EXA I don't have exactly idea of what will be the physical properties that separate them let's just call them like on in like outside variable one two and inside variable one two for now and um they will they must have many different relationship with each other because um before like just a little recap on the talk we had earlier we said that um you know between the inside and outside system it is an inverse relationship meaning that one increase another decrease and vice versa but would that necessarily be the case for every single relationship between let's say those variables were one variable with the other variables here um in order to do that I think um what an idea um would be that um what would be a third Direction on single axis because um we know that that you know either the relationship will be one or another but it may not be both at the same times at least at least it can be in the 3D system because you are either uh on the axis you're moving negative or positive you you don't have a third Direction on a single axis in the 3D system whenever you are trying to involve another Direction now you're involving another uh axis so it's impossible to do that in 3D system but could it be possible in a 5D system and what would that third directional single access means and um I don't necessarily think it means like an entirely New Direction in the sense of you know negative and positive but um it could mean something like simultaneously which is you know it is it can be both positive and negative at the same time so two answers are both correct so um in order to represent that um I try to represent using a FY byin which see here so this is what it looks like in 3D space but um just before I go into it um all the imagery here is kind of the C the 3D crosssection of this violin so I try to use a 3D you know something we know to get this idea across this is definitely not what the thing looks like you know 5D space but you know I think um for the illustration purpose um when I represent this um using something we know that we understand but um 5D space the imagery is probably so forunate and distorted that we wouldn't make sense of it as of yet so so yeah let me get started so uh for the so here is a little recap of what it looks like in 40 space so uh ideally you have a inside um outside cross-section and the inside cross-section of the violin so there are identical but um the two two directions but um if we take previous idea of two variables representing each one of them then um right here I use the uh the surface seams to represent one variable and the faces to represent the other variable so now you have two variables here and two variables here so so you have four different variables representing kind of four variables um representing the two systems you know for the space so now you can see there's four variables um we go to next page ideally you should say um there there is four outputs right because you have um output one with like uh like a outside variable one with outside variable two inside variable one with inside variable two and now you can combine the outside variable one with inside variable two and inside variable one with outside variable two so you have four different combinations so right here it's kind of like the relationships and um that's kind of like the relationship between different access systems think about that way and that gives you um different properties that you can manipulate um on which directly affect the inside and outside system of a 4D space so that is you know on the output alone there's four output but if there is a idea of a certain direction inside the 5D space which means simultaneously um that means um the relationship between them can be both inverse and the same um identical at the same time so you will get two outputs from each of the output groups right here so one that has both of those coordinate system as a inverse relationship and one as a identical relationship so basically you know on total you might have as much as eight outputs from one single 3D input on 5D system so um and I think you know what what does that mean uh I think that means that all those eight outputs is what really you can manipulate to control control the physical properties inside the 5D space which in turn affects 4D space in turn affects 3D space so yeah I think um for very complicated concept like this um the most accurate way to represent how it will really look like you know 5D space is uh by you know concept art so let me introduce concept arst EST hi everyone um so I'm G to talk about Dune in the 40 dimension in four dimension um so Dune is this uh like science fiction novel that was written by Frank arbert for people who don't know and so um this first piece is about a scene in the story where um that's called The Water of Life ceremony um and this is when lady Jessica the mother of Paul is um undergoing a ritual to become the Reverend mother and so uh to do that she has to drink the water of life and um ironically this uh drink is poisonous and so um she has to fight the poison once she drinks it and survives um but here what's going on is that she's actually pregnant and the people are not aware of that she's the only one who knows and um the baby inside of her once she drinks the poison um like is impacted by it and suddenly becomes aware and conscious and there's a very deep connection happening between the baby and her and so what I my what my intention is um here is to play with like the inside and the outside and so um here we are inside of the baby and at the same time U the baby is inside of her so there's like it's it's uh everything is happening at the same time um and so I'm also playing with uh uh so the the ladies that we can see behind her um their face is a little uh scary because we can see um their skull um and at the same time can also see their skin and their flesh so it's a little um yeah special but um this is because of this idea of um seeing the inside and the outside at the same at the same time um and so I'm trying to challenge the xuy space um and the materiality of objects in this um representation yeah um and uh so this is the first scene the second scene that I did is um the fight between Paul and his cousin fed Roa aranan this happens later in the story and this is a very um like violent uh scene and they they both get injured ured in that fight and so um my intention here is to again play with uh like the inside the outside um but I'm trying to do it a little bit differently here um and also this depth of the of the scene and uh right now it's all flat but that's on purpose because we can't really see like four dimensional space um and so uh here what we have is on the outer rim of the image we can see those abstracts shape and and um lighting and color and it's uh it's representing the inside of Paul and then um in the middle Rim we have the Silhouettes of Paul and his cousin fighting and um and at the same time we can see a little bit of the inside of Paul as well inside of his Silhouettes and that's like just a a repetition with what's happening in the outer room and um in the middle of their fight we can actually see the outside of the scene and um so the exterior of yeah if we want to call it that and um and here we can see the crowd uh looking at them fighting and also we can see um his cousin again and he's multiplied um in different angles to um to mimic how um the four dimension could uh could look like um and uh yeah I think that's uh that's all I have to say for this one and I think ector might might say something or take it away yes sure thanks St thanks for having me all of you uh I would like to say that uh this is mind-blowing I mean Jim your drawings are spectacular I mean they are so elegant and so Technical and I think they make a good contrast with st which is more figurative and it also is mindblowing what you produced and I would like to go with this first scene to comment something that I thought it was remarkable if you can help me Jim to put the the drawing of St the first one I think back back up a little bit Jim to where I was the first scene that I yeah that's the one that's the one yeah because I read the book long time ago and I remember this passage of the book which is quite uh intense right and one detail that I especially like is on top of the image this kind of bluish dark thing uh it reminds me of the sky at night right but if we think in the Inside Out allegory this could also be the the amniotic liquid in which the baby is immersed right so I don't know this was St intention but I think this is very very significant because it's like the perspective of inside outside simultaneous right you cannot get more inside the belly of the mother and the this amniotic fluid and you cannot get more external that the outer space so it's like I like this because it's this image evokes everything it's like simultaneously inside outside right and and also reminds me of the the the last ma stream when you show this duck and rabbit this image that can be a rabbit or a duck but you are unable to see both simultaneously so sometimes you see a duck sometimes you see a rabbit right and this remind me of that it's like you can have this both leaving simultaneously and and I think this is very nice it's another metaphorical or more artistic way of think of this extra Dimension so congratulations to both of you of course you okay perfect Jim I'll take it over here do you me to share on my side all right okay so now that we've seen some visual depictions I want to sort of do a a slight enhancement of the situation and so um Jim and I were thinking you know if you're going to talk about higher spatial Dimensions well what would be the accompanying time of that higher spatial Dimension so we just want to have a a slight um fun exploration into maybe possible versions of time that would accompany these higher spaces so maybe something like non archimedian time right so I just want to sort of throw some points out there um sort of very minimalistic and see what we can think of so you know any kind of non- archimedian Norm or sort of like a size like on the rationals has something very interesting that if you take an open ball um that any point inside the the open ball is actually the center so the non- archimedian norm is actually very strange it has like a a different triangle property and so um you know as I've said before Chris fields and I always talk about like um time being in tropic or linear time being entropic that learning exceeds forgetting and so you have to think about a non- archimedian time if every point was the actual uh every point in the open ball was the center what does that mean for learning what does it mean for um just navigating so we're going to pull in the active inference like a portion of the talk right now so and I was having this idea like okay so if onedimensional time is sort of you can kind of mimic it like the real lines that sitting inside the complex numbers then what would be another axis of time now this is not new so Stephen Hawking a lot of people a lot of theoretical physicists work in imaginary time where they do like a wick rotation or they have this other axis um that's not quite what I'm talking about here I was thinking like if if we think of um linear time as again like the real numbers and say we're sitting here at this pink dot on the x axis like three comma zero say if the y- AIS was actually zero this is like you know our stream right now math Arts stream five well you know the linear time has this peculiar um asymmetry to it that we seem to not be able to really in real time access something like yesterday so I was thinking like the you know total opposite point this Green Point sitting at like -3 comma 0 what would that be that would seem to be like past which seems to be unaccessible so if you want to add like a second dimensional coordinate to time here I just thought hm what would be the point like 3 comma 5 what would that mean so if 3 comma 0 was math Arts stream five then what would 3 comma 5 be and and so it's like if if time were no longer linear but it could take this planer view you have all very like new ways of of moving you could move instead of just forward backward you have a sort of diagonal you can sort of um almost like a sheet time is now this sheet and so likewise what would this like you know -35 be and so you have to think like if like what is entropic time and what what would be non- entropic time like maybe everything you cannot access on the other side of the Y AIS like whatever that means would be non- entropic and then everything on the pink is like entropic so when you're trying to think about higher Dimension dimensional time you could sort of try to base it on the real numbers and like sitting inside the complex numbers so something else um Jim if you want to explain this one first and then I'll explain it as well so we have another two-day time concept A Little More physics okay um so for this one um I think um like why I try to came up with it I ask myself what is time right what is our definition of time because um if we assume that the heat death of universe is real then you know when heat death happens then you know nothing is moving you cannot observe any change there's like literally nothing that's changing and um that's that mean at that time um time have stopped because there is nothing that changes I think um so what I think is time in itself is just change in you know all the matters everything in the universe um physically and that um when we're talking about like uh right now we're on a linear time U which we can either go forward or backward you know backward is possible but also not possible right now um but if also you know in another word um the big shrink um is real then you know in that Universe you know time is going backward and you know you have that you know matter kind of you know um condense into one stuff to the end so so what would a planer time look like so the planer time you know have that really the reverse and forward motion but they also have that upward and downward motion and what does that upward and downward motion kind of represents so we know that um know you know reverse and forward motion what it represent is really you know like those atom Atomic Collisions everything that happens into the you know what we call the next stage but it is really just those physical matter change and um if we can control that in another word it means that we have control or matters so what would be that other variable um be controlling I think that's something that controls um probability and outcome so uh if we can control those you know like matters like you know either let the reaction go forward or backward and then um the upward downward will be to controlling you know the interaction of every single um atom so whether one interacts with another or not so that's something um you can you can control and I would say you know each of those control variables would give you a different result and the same know same precedence like um so when put one president same president together you normally you will only get one same but if you have control over that probability outcome then now you can get to any result you want so it's you another world really like the many world theory but now you have control over which path you can get into the next stage if let's say you move time forward or backward so yeah that's my idea I love it um and then continuing you know so you can say we're going to talk a little bit about like entropy as a variable and then you can just keep going what would be 3D time if you want to take this systematically then you can say okay so now I have time represented as a three tle XYZ so this is not like past present future because that would all be on one line and so I think this is really kind of exceptional to go out here and think well what in the world would that be so now my time is represented in three coordinates instead of everybody you know meeting it 10:30 am Pacific time for our lovely stream like what would that be all right and of course I'll go one more so um if you go to 40 time and then I stopped there I thought that was a little that's this is hard enough so um the nice thing about the GIF on the right hand side is that this is um Tesseract and so which is like one of the simplest 4D um objects sort of like the Clifford tourus which is a 40 hypersphere but the what you want to note here is that uh the motion is necessary to convey that the inside Cube becomes the outside Cube so if you watch the inside Cube it will slly stretch open and become the outside Cube so that's what Jim and EST Stella are talking about the whole time inside is outside inside is outside and so I mean gez so if time was that some sort of like four tle now that took that sort of form that inside was outside perhaps that's the time that I dream of like the time of a simultaneous experience and again I always say it's like an example of a simultaneous experience would be that we're all Cambridge Apostles and uh but we're also at aroan and Pasadena my favorite store like now and so you know um as when Jim did the sort of cross-sections of the 5D violin because it's very difficult to squish that onto like a 2d plane um you know you can work at cross-sections we can also think about boundaries so we know that the boundary of this Tesseract is um you know eight 3D cubes and so if you're going to you know give time that same sort of fabric then time would also have some sort of boundary um and so would 40 time be like the temporal version of eight 3D cubes like whatever that is and we're trying not to spatialize time but if you were I think that's a little strange um so we can get a little stranger and talk about maybe something like fractal time so I've always been fascinated with fractals fractals have a very very technical definition I'm just going to say one property is that they're self-similar at all scales so if you zoom in the local Behavior looks like the global behavior and so A beautiful example of a fractal curve is What's called the virr function and so uh it it's um originally conjectured by vross and it was written as a fouryear series and if you look at this beautiful curve um it's showing this sort of local Global Behavior which is characteristic of fractal so the Red Dot on the bottom corner is zoomed if you zoom into that red dot you can see that the actual shape inside the Red Dot is totally mimicking the global behavior and that's very powerful that you have this self-similarity at all scales and so virus St shows that you know well here's a function that is continuous everywhere but nowhere differentiable and so um you know pulling that back like is would fractal time be entropic again where learning exceeds forgetting I'm not sure like there's a before after with something like this and sort of like okay it's um you know 10:32 Pacific time in Los Angeles and then you zoom into that and what is that so zooming in is it's it's I don't know like is time selfsimilar that would be something very very very curious um to sort of think about then of course you can go to like category Theory so I've tried this before that if you were now to take like to use a categorical time so time would not no longer take place in like sets of numbers the set of 10:35 a.m. it would take a value in a category so it's no longer in sets it's almost like one step up so if you remember what a groupoid is me oh yeah okay so you can go to um so in categorical time so time would take values in these groupoids and so um a groupoid is a small category which every morphism is actually invertible and so that's actually very peculiar if you think of um objects as categories as objects that have sight and can be seen and so um what would that actually mean to have a categorical time that you're now taking values in the groupoid of of of like numbers which is kind of interesting okay there's also a version like dark time so in my like in my dark Imaginarium idea or the dark Consciousness idea you have this Paradox of infinite identity that also eludes the present so um the the what makes this time dark is that Alice is becoming bigger and smaller at the same time you heard the word simultaneous a lot today and so um Alice becomes L you know larger than she was but smaller than she becomes and so this is actually kind of something I think a little curious that the time of simultaneity would be the time Paradox of infinite identity and so now I actually want to um poke Daniel and Hector with some questions that I thought were a little tricky and so taking this sort of um if we're taking this uh like temporal kind of enhancement of higher Dimensions I want to sort of poke Hector and then Daniel about like bringing in time um you know in Fe and bringing in some like math art friends at the moment I think the time of surprisal is very curious so I just want to know if anyone could um Hector would you like to kind of like speak on that and also I have like three questions just for you two in particular okay yeah I can and then Daniel can correct me uh I I think that initially time and surprisal appear as independent concept right I mean it's kind of weird to think that there is a time of surprise um but thinking in in in Surprise as an estate I I mean um it involves that you have a linearity of time right for instance if I am surprised is because before I was not surprised so if I'm surprised in time B we need to imply that I was not surprised at some previous time a so in this sense it would make sense right to talk of time of surprisal and just to add some kind of educational part of active inference when we talk of surprise and active inference this is borrowed from information Theory and Cloud CL Shannon work and shanon would perhaps think of surprise as something that brings about information right but if we go to the formalism of active inference and here Daniel knows a lot more than me um surprise can only be considered in relation to the generative model so you've got this generative model of the world which is a represent ation of the information we have about the world we live in our environment the contingencies and these models allow us to make predictions so whenever something happens that we could not have predicted with these models this is surprising to us so that would be like bringing surprise in relation to generative model and I think I can pass it on to Daniel now thank you also thanks for the awesome math Arts to keep it addressing the question first I just want to reiterate I think the point that I heard from what Hector said which is Shannon information so-called is basically something like symbol entropy that's almost like a frequentist information concept because it has a flat prior with respect to like oh but then this pattern usually happens so then when we talk about surprise and surprise isal in active inference different people use these very similarly sounding words sometimes you know one of the other so hey pay attention but surprise is calculated in information Theory units like bits or gats about a given data point was what was the surprise of that data point oh the coin comes up 50/50 so then how surprising was this observation or the coin I have a prior that it's 9010 how surprising was that observation and so just like Hector said that's calculated with respect to a generative model which may or may not have any other time clocks like maybe it's also Consulting a cesium atom or maybe it's looking at the wall or maybe it's only looking at the coin flip and so it's Timeless in between those another concept that's related though is surprise o or basian surprise which is the K Divergence of the prior to the posterior which is to say how much does that data point move the prior to the posterior so you could have a high surprise observation with a surprise L of zero I saw um a five Sigma event and I didn't change my beliefs so high information from the surprise calculation but then it wasn't surprise all whereas you could also have something that was very close or unsurprising that also updated beliefs in a in a different way so that kind of connects with this learning as time and then just the last piece here the interface and the inner and the outer space is like considering exteroception and interoception so it's like we're looking at a painting or listening to sounds but painting and then that painting is like it's you could think of it as an a spa a spatial space or in a space of art styles or some there's a space that that external thing is in and then you're having points observations like points from Inner Space inner bodily or inner cognitive and those are also implicitly in this dark space of what could have been so then there's like the inner and the outer dark space and the inner and the outer observations and what is the observation apparatus it's the interface or it's on the [Music] interface wow all right very interesting I just wanted to add something that um now that you very well commented on the different Basin um surprise and surprise that is not Basin that's kind of tricky and interesting difference right because it's the same event may cause you to kind of rine or update your predictions or change it to to to introduce this new information uh but you can't just ignore this thing that doesn't fit with a model and then there is just surprise right it's not based on surprise and that's I think that's very very funny right and one other thing I would like to add is the the concept of novelty which is something that is not surpris right novelty is when something happens that you cannot retrieve from memory so it's something that you don't have in your memory that's novel that's novelty uh where a surprise is something unexpected it so we can also this entangle novelty and surprise which is something that I think it's also very interesting right in this active INF formalism wow thank you both um two more so I would like to ask you about the time of autop poas um which is a concept I think is very tricky as well and not to be compared with like morphogenesis so let's keep these kind of separate if we can um so rough idea autop poesis is the capacity of a system to create its own parts or maintain itself um I have a little announcement about what the next stream is going to be but um I would like like Hector to can you explain this one a little bit and then Daniel jump in this is fascinating what this time would actually be okay I give a short and then I pass it on to Daniel um I would say that again there are kind of clashing concept if you will um but um off the top of my head I would say that time of aop is the time that a system exists like resist entropic dissipation because it keeps its boundaries right I mean Matana and Vel I think they Define this aasis I think they they apply it to cells and there's the system that regenerate and they have boundaries so I think that time of autois is the time a system keeps its boundaries intact and resist entropic dissipation because otherwise there there is no system anymore right it sees to be a system like myself if I don't drink it I don't eat if I keep my temperature I become something else per the corpse later on atoms so time of toasis is the time Hector is Hector I would say and I Daniel the floor is yours wow yeah it's a great interesting question I think there it also invokes a lot of the themes we've been discussing it made me wonder time from whose perspective so there could be a few situations like there's a parent clock or parent with a clock that develops and Spins off a child with their own clock and then maybe the clocks maybe the the child's clock slows down Through Time relative to the parent let's just say um so then that would lead to that kind of differential or maybe the parent is in a higher Dimension so then they're in the 3D time clock and they're dropping these projected 1D clocks so then the child's time was like in the entropic line um then I think there's Hector's great point about well once the thing can't sustain the cognitive capacity like the physical part of the quantum reference frame once it can't maintain that SL it believes I can't maintain that then it what happens and that's like sleep and death so there's so many places there and also another one last piece was so let's just say that there's the parent with the clock and then the child with the clock and so they start to desync but that would be the whole Quantum question how do they know that they're desync but let just say that we're all knowing we're watching them desync each of them are making another estimate was how normal does time feel now which is in in it's an aspect of our time perception so like does the feeling of time speed up or slow down through the lifetime but some some people say oh but when you're younger you've had fewer experiences so then each experience is like a bigger proportion people say things like that I I don't know but it it may feel normal because of the timing being self-generated but the fact that it was feeling normal wouldn't mean it had anything related to stability it's very interesting Daniel this idea of the concept that is not objective right an external think um I think there are lots we can discuss later about this uh I just I was thinking before when when Shana talk of fractal time what would it be to not have language or numbers how would be our perception of time without numbers and language just think about it I think it would be more fral it would be less linear because we wouldn't have any frame reference frame to count how much time how much days how many hours how many minutes the events will be more like this Stone space right will be kind or will be the center of the ball we don't have I don't know I mean I'm going too far by imagining how it is without language or numbers but I think we would lose a lot of our feeling of passing of time don't you think so one one thought on the fractal time there so is it similar or different how seconds are related to each other and how minutes are related to each how days are related to each other like do they follow similarly the metric time proposal which didn't really catch on so then slower relative to the counter like if someone said hey keep track of the years but that might be in a certain kind of physical memory and then January and you make a few errors but then you catch on you make whereas if someone said keep track of the seconds you might use like a phonological loop strategy or counting your heartbeats or so so someone said to keep track of the hours you you may or may not think about that you might count seconds you might count minutes you might just make you might look at the Sun so then there's a lot of ways that would you could look at the time and try to count the the Pico seconds but then what is that what would that even mean when there's so little this is something we have written um together with Shana and Michael Michael Walker about this idea of Consciousness and how you are conscious not of the time what you dreaming right and and I think what you say Daniel um is like you might be able to to calculate how much seconds have elapsed since we started or minut it right and I think this might have to do with biological rhythms and hormonal release whatever but I think there is another feeling of time which is more subjective and I believe it's related directly with our memories with our episodic memory this is what we discuss with Shan and Michael that and this idea that when I'm doing something that is exciting and this is something I've thought for lots of years when you have an a year with many events that are distinctive and very peculiar when the year has passed you remember you think that year was huge was long was extremely long because you can recall very significant or ideosyncratic events and when you are doing something routinary every single day this day you think it's very long it never ends right but when you think about it one year later you think it it flyed because there is nothing remarkable to stop when you remember so that's my own kind of theory about about this subjective time that is very different when you're experiencing something that is monotonous it's it's long but if you repeat this day today when you think about your life many years later time flight and I think that's has to do with this episodic recollection not with the hormonal or the circadian rhythms or any kind of mechanism to estimate how much time has elapsed and I don't know it makes sense so great all right I want to ask just two more things everyone I love this conversation so lastly um I know we are very fascinated by morphogenesis and we've talked a little bit about you know um take a crystal list turning into a butterfly sort of like um where is the memory if you have a sort of a um liquid central nervous system or something like this um could you possibly remember this is going to feed into our next stream which is really exciting but so morphogenesis is the process by which a system acquires a shape um can you both speak to what you see as um the very complicated time of of that and also possibly identity of the thing that's trying to acquire Daniel you w to go it's only fair it's only fair I'm really looking forward to discussing it more in the Fantastical math Arts to come it made me think about a a Continuum or space of possibilities from um a kind of model or thing or organism where its material morphology was its computational Anatomy like its anatomy and physiology were isomorphic or were highly related that's not all the seeming causal statistical explanation of the brain which is the difference between the structural and the functional connectivity which is you make statistical models that include statistical effects between brain regions that don't necessarily have a given direct connection you know Asis Asis as all that so we have on one hand systems like basian graphs that we def in RX INF fur. JL where something about their actual connectivity their actual morphology is maybe even directly cognitive and then there's systems in the complex adaptive systems we see are more on this end of the pool where their morphological substrate is extremely flexible and multiple quote layers or layers of abstraction in a kind of up up up different articulation that makes it possible to talk about semantics and the connectivity of semantics connectivity of language and things like that without reference to the tongue and you know the auditory cortex and because it's different layers of of difference so and I think this is the sort of Mike Len at all question and topic is what what is that with the material and the cognitive and where does Harry Potter fit into all of that yay surprise yeah so wow or even like the morphogenesis of like oh now we're four-dimensional creatures like I think the time of that iring an entirely like new dimension like as you know similar to oh I now have a a fe falling perhaps if I turn into a bird or something you know so that's very interesting unlik a fish no fear of falling it's like I'm a fish I'm a fish um all right I G to end with something a little fun I mean I keep saying that okay so if if we had this higher dimensional um you know creature and if you do have like these new versions of time a of poesis morphogenesis I am a four-dimensional creature I just want any everyone's thoughts anybody here on what you think um a four-dimensional creature or something would hear what would 4D sound take form as so normally you know like um sound is a you know you have a longitudinal wave that's sort compressing it looks like a foure transform hitting the ear so analog digital but then it's sort of memory which makes you remember this is Shana talking very very interesting if you have no memory you probably have no sound I'll let Hector speak on that but so if you have this you know plain wave coming into the ear then is it just okay I have a three-dimensional now a three-dimensional uh surface as a fouryear transform or what's actually happening there with the sound uh if anyone can kind of speak on that and and then we're done I'm going to take this one because this is a very exciting idea um I was just thinking and this is something that with with d r which is mathematician too um you don't listen notes you listen a symphony and that I think it's a good metaphor of this four-dimensional time I'm listening a symphony I'm listening I'm not listening a cacophony of sing single notes I'm listening a unitary thing so the instruments are playing together and what I listen is something that is together togetherness right and also with language I'm not listening to isana produce lot of PHS disconnected that I cannot keep keep Pace with them I'm listening words that make sense so I I think that could be a good metaphor of this 4D sound when I make sense of all and it simultaneously I and this this sport this idea you're commenting on memory maybe without memory I wouldn't recognize or listen to your words I would then listen to the symphony it would more like this parade Stone space things if you will thank you I'll I'll give a closing thought and then and then any other short notes there's so many ways to quote see the fourth dimension and more so it's been awesome to be on this journey Hector took it in a direction of notes to wholeness I thought of a sound engineer in the Symphony Hall asking about there's a space I'm considering and I'm hearing it with a lot of the treble but I know that I'm closer to this so how will they hear it there so how will this future time how will that sound be heard by them than there and then they have more of a space of consideration like just kind of that inductive method for dimensions and time that that Jim and shenana basically demonstrated it's very rich in giving us different ways to see it Daniel that's so beautiful yeah because I always think like you don't hear sound sound is a longitudinal wave it's like your brain doing all this right so it's like semantic yeah so cool yeah well I wanted to say everyone so thank you again if you want to see any of these um images I've updated this preprint and then we can also find Mom Jim's website I also want to just like give a plugin so we're actually going to take kind of a shift to exploring Fantastical World worlds of Harry Potter and particularly like um Dementors and Anam Magus from the Viewpoint of episodic memory and um and active inference we think it's going to be like really really really beautiful and I want to thank all my colleagues here Pelle JY Daniel and Hector for such a beautiful stream yeah thank you thank you great times see you in number six okay thank you guys thank you bye e
