  "description": "Visualizing the 4th Dimension II: Retinal Path and 5D\nJim Zhong, Shanna Dobson\nIn this talk, we discuss Concept Points 3, 4, and 5, of our recent paper Categorical Mental Imagery: Visualizing the 4th Spatial Dimension https://philpapers.org/rec/DOBVTT . We will discuss what we call the three-dimensional retinal perspective path and multi-origin perspective, and show animations of perspective paths in higher dimensions.  This talk is part two of our Visualizing the 4th Dimension MathArt Stream 3. \n\nActive Inference Institute information: \nWebsite: https://activeinference.org/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InferenceActive \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/8VNKNp4jtx \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ActiveInference/ \nActive Inference Livestreams: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/livestreams",
