- What is the dimension of empty space?
- How can I visualize a negative Dimension?
- What is the dimension of a point?
- Wouldn't we need something like a fourth dimensional eyeball with a three-dimensional retina in order to see a fourth spatial Dimension?
- How can we attempt to visualize such a feat when we are immersed in 3D Concepts?
- How can we visualize un knotting knots in R4?
- How do we visualize a four dimension spatial system?
- How do we visualize something that has no Collision of inside and outside?
- How do one perspective see the inside shrink and outside expand at the same time?
- What do the authors think would happen to the concept of fitting when a fourth dimension is introduced?
- How do you connect this with design or how do you see this in relation with design?
- Can you elaborate a little bit on what fitting means?
- Where do you both go from this work?
