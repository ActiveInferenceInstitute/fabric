hello and welcome this is math art stream 3 on May 31st 2024 categorical mental imagery visualizing the fourth spatial Dimension it should be a great set of presentations and discussions so thank you both for joining Shana and Jim and so to you for M your stream in the background on May 31st 2024 categorical mental imagery visualizing the fourth spatial Dimension we call that a strange Loop close the YouTube though if you have it open through the fourth dimension of time the live stream speaking to itself but just close that window if you have open ch um but okay unmute then and continue with the presentation to you go for it oh yes yes if you have it open somewhere or unmute and it's all good but if you hear any other audio your side um but okay unmute then and continue with the presentation to you go for it oh yes yes I don't have anything open Daniel if you have it open somewhere or unmute and that's all good but if you hear any other audio but I think well if we were the presentation I don't think I have anything open have anything open if you have it open somewhere or unmute and that's all good but if you hear any other audio I think one of we might have some technical difficulties here but I think it's on the right T on the YouTube tab one um not keep going keep going more more to the right have some techic difficulties here I think it's on the right tab um on the YouTube tab there's another YouTube um we stop keep going we will return briefly from some technical audio visual difficulties e e we are back from a brief glitch experience so please continue shann great thank you so much for having us Daniel so um today Jim and I are going to be taking us into the the four spatial Dimension so last week we had an incredible back from a brief glitch experience M again so please continue shad e e e e okay continue all right everybody welcome back one more time all right so Jim and I will be um walking us into the fourth spatial Dimension today and so I want to say a couple things we had such an incredible talk last week from Dean and Stephen about uh jumping into paintings losing yourself in the painting to find yourself again w finding getting out of the reflective frame I was playing around with like miso mathematics all right and so today we want to uh throw ourselves into a um a fourth-dimensional painting all right so I want to have an opening imagination with everyone all right so if you would please close your eyes and we're going to imagine something together okay everybody all right so I want you to imagine a triple scoop um ice cream cone so there's one scoop of chocolate chip for all the chocolate chip lovers out there a scoop of pink Buble gum and a scoop of cherry ice cream all on a on a freshly baked waffle cone you can smell the waffle cone say we walk outside it's a little warm the ice cream starts melting and all the flavors are mixing together you have sticky hands and now let's imagine it's fourth-dimensional ice cream fourth dimensional ice cream fourth dimensional stickiness like let's let's let's try to hold on to that for a second dimension is a concept that is a little intricate and it has various incarnations depending on the field of mathematics you approach it from so from the topology side there's a definition in terms of covering from algebraic geometry there's a definition in terms of sheaths from category Theory there's another definition in terms of endomorphisms and so this concept of dimension is actually really interesting so let's try to actually play with this a little bit I want to ask a question what is the dimension of empty space now you might be thinking Shana that's sort of a ridiculous question because it's supposed to be empty right there's like what what's inside the space it's supposed to be I understand that can be a little a little problematic of a question so of course we can resort to a category Theory to try to work our way through this question so in category Theory we have something called negative thinking right and so a nice definition says the following negative thinking is a way of thinking about categorification by considering what the original concept is a categorification of so more generally negative thinking can apply whenever you have a sequence of mathematical objects and you want to ask yourself what came before the beginning so using negative thinking we can find ourselves saying that empty space has precisely Dimension negative one right because the empty space is the categorification of Point H okay but you're like Shannon you just made it worse how can I visualize a negative Dimension now I agree that's also a little tricky negative dimensional ice cream should I do like a curvature kind of like visualization on this how am I supposed to visualize this so the typical response I get when I ask someone this is well Define a negative Dimension first and then I can mentally visualize it h so are we saying that we can only visualize what we know what we can axiomatize doeses this mean that knowing comes before imagining be before visualizing so you're going to say I believe it because I can physically see it okay thus I know it because I can mentally see it well you're going to get into a little bit of trouble there uh especially in the quantum mechanics or as Sean Carroll calls it auster quantum mechanics there there really is what we see and then there really is what really is so if you take the many worlds view of quantum mechanics there's only a Quantum wave function evolving over time for the sh andure equation and position and velocity those are what you see but it's not what really is so how are you actually going to do this if you're like I can't visualize it until I Define it I don't believe it until I see it when what you see might not be what really is let's try something easier what is the dimension of a point you're like well a point is like a it's supposed to be a Zero Dimensional thing right but I can draw it how does that really work all right so let's look to category Theory right so the categorical definition of a point is not really so easy it is enlightening so we say as a category we can interpret the point as a category with a single object the point and a single morphism the identity morphism on the object which is not going to be shown in a picture of a DOT because it's automatic so this can be generalize recursively to higher categories as an N plus one category the point consists of a single object Point whose endomorphism in category is the point now understood as an in category so in the limit the point can even be understood as an Infinity category with a unique J morphism for each J greater than or equal to zero Each of which is an identity for J greater than zero how is that helping us well the definition of a point is zero the dimension of a point is zero okay so now we feel a little bit like the White Queen well sometimes I believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast well it's 10:00 a.m. it's not quite breakfast so we have time to imagine one and here here's one okay let's imagine a fourth-dimensional snowflake I picked a snowflake because like it has this sort of geometric rigidity you think you could outline it but it still seems very difficult it may not be as drippy and sticky as ice cream that's melting but this is also kind of difficult so one way that we can actually visualize a fourth-dimensional object um is to try to you know try to come at it through a couple questions questions um maybe something with the ey so wouldn't we need something like a fourth dimensional eyeball with a three-dimensional retina in order to see a fourth spatial Dimension so ordinarily you have a three-dimensional eye with a two-dimensional retina so a creature that could see in fourth Dimensions would have a 3D retina then you have the other question like well how can we attempt to like visualize such a feat when we are immersed in 3D Concepts like in inside and outside which may not apply in a fourth dimension all right so you know we can look to category theories I'm trying to do in some of these papers of my categorical colors on diamonds like visual site is categorical site right how you supposed to do this when you're embedded in this 3D concept world we don't really have 3D retinas well one way of doing this is to use color to work um in the fourth dimension all right so what you do it's very fun so if we work in ukian space in Tuple space we can use color as the fourth dimensional W coordinate so you're used to having XYZ for three dimensions and we'll let the fourth dimensional coordinate W be color so um this means that we denote a point in R4 as a point of R3 that carries a color so there exists this color assignation we assign a point the colors say white if the W uh coordinate is zero so that means it's in 3D space but then we can illustrate moving into the fourth dimension byang changing the color of the point to say pink for the what was called the Ana Direction which is like this the the positive numbers in the fourth dimension and then blue for the C Direction which is like the negative numbers right so Anna means we're moving in the fourth um pink denotes we're moving in the Anna Direction blue denotes we're moving in the Conor Direction okay so another way is to use not Theory to sort of get there so a typical knot um is defined as follows so we let s one denote the circle or the one sphere and so formly a nod is defined as a particular embedding uh from S1 into R3 so it's known that you can by changing Crossings any knot can be unnoted in the fourth dimension so means there exist no non-trivial knots in the fourth dimension what does that mean you formalize it like this we say an embedding of the form S1 to R4 is called a trivial knot because it can be unnoted so that means the trivial knot can be continuously deformed to S1 all right so back to the circle so through these continuous deformations you take something that was knotted in the 3D space but it's unnoted in the 4D space so how can we visualize un knotting knots in R4 well let's work in the color Dimension like we set up so we can change the crossings we can pull the under Arc past the over Arc of the crossing by first taking the under Arc into the fourth dimension where it changes to pink right so take the under Arc into pink then you can come back to the third dimension so the under Arc becomes white and then you can slide it over the over Arc because the arcs are no longer living in the same point the same point in R4 is XYZ um W the same color voila so you've unnoted a knot wolm has this talks about this a awesome method called dragging all right so to get to a higher dimensional space um this seems like something I Dean would like is like dragging okay seems like very um very ski all right so we say the following so to see how lower and higher Dimensions relate to each other take any geometric object drag it in an opposing Direction okay so you can drag a point to trace out a line drag a line to trace out a box drag a circle to trace out a cylinder right so the result is an object which is qualitatively larger than the previous object um qualitative in the sense that regardless of how you drag it you always Trace out an object of the same qualitative size we say but the object could be made into a straight line a circle a helix or some other curve but all of these are qualitatively of the same Dimension right this is what gives you the flavor that Dimension is a topological notion okay so here's the r finite collections of objects points in space are considered Zero Dimensional now objects that are dragged versions of zero dimensional objects are called onedimensional okay okay so um objects which are dragged one-dimensional objects are two-dimensional okay so the higher Dimension is the dragged version of the lower thing all right dragged Looking Glass okay so let's play with this so thus a fourth-dimensional object is a dragged version of a three-dimensional object okay by negative thinking a zero dimensional object is a dragged version of a negative onedimensional object all right okay now dragging a negative onedimensional object sounds incredibly challenging right so we can really relate to Alice you know Louis Caroll where she's you know having trouble cutting the Looking Glass cake all right this is like dragged Looking Glass cake all right but let's make it a little easier so sometimes when it's like if the dragging doesn't work and color doesn't work you can also work by a boundary argument right so this is pretty standard because how else are we going to get to the fourth dimension all right so you can think of it this way so the boundary of a one-dimensional object this isn't really one diim but if I had a line right the boundary of this actual line would be two points two zero dimensional objects and I can keep going the boundary of a two-dimensional object like something like like a plane it's my Post-It note but the boundary is like four lines right four one-dimensional objects the boundary of a three-dimensional object you can just keep going right is six two dimensional objects almost like you know if you had a cube like a Rubik's Cube the boundar is the faces and then to get to the fourth dimension you just carry you carry on with this pattern so the boundary of a fourth-dimensional object is eight Rubik's Cubes so if we were at a party and it's like my birthday and you brought me a gift I'm like oh I'm so excited it's like my fourth dimensional birthday party I'd have to cut through like the wrapping paper of eight Rubik's Cubes to get the gift okay this is like a little wild that the boundary of this shape is so complicated all right so to visualize the fourth spatial Dimension we could try and visualize the boundary is 8 cubes this is quite unfriendly okay and we're gonna have hopefully better images like to help us okay so we're GNA start with a very fun analysis from the color Dimension right so we're going to set up um our color scheme as follows so we view a point in four-dimensional space as a point in R3 that has a color Okay so we're going to denote bubblegum pink the Ana Direction and the four spatial Dimension right royal blue will be the cata direction right so like forwards backwards okay so we're going to denote by Snow White um a w coordinate that equals the value zero meaning you're you're not in the third dimension uh sorry we're not in the fourth dimension we're in the third dimension okay okay so here's Artemis all right my beautiful little girl all right so Artemis is sleeping all right so one of her favorite pastimes now in the third dimension viewing this we're like oh emis is sleeping she's so happy we want to love her and like pet her okay so that's amazing but if you analyze it from the fourth-dimensional sort of color perspective you can see that well rm's nose ears like paw pads and tummy would be off in the fourth dimension while the rest of the Snow White colors are in the third dimension and you can think of this that as artms gets more and more pink she's traveling away into the fourth dimension this might be like denoting her dream state so you can see these states of EMS getting more pink and more white this is like color maybe like a color schema for what dreams would look like okay so there's this sense of like that Artemis is like this Chesire emis all right so viewing emus asleep while her pink nose and ears are in the fourth dimension really kind of conjures up an image of the chesher cat which is you know brilliant character in Louis Carol's um Alice Wonderland so the treasure cat has this remarkable remarkable ability to make his body slowly or suddenly disappear leaving only his head while in full conversation with someone particularly Alice okay so Alice and the treasure cat have an exchange the treasure cat says did you say pig or fig said the cat I said Pig said Alice and I I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and Vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly begin beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remain sometime after the rest of it had gone well I've often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice but a grin without a cat is the most curious thing I've ever saw in my life so chesher cat chesher Artemis so interestingly we could say that the chesher cats Vanishing denotes his moving into the fourth dimension in particular we could thus say that so the chesher cat is a marvelous creature that can simultaneously exist in three dimensions and four dimensions at once all the while remaining in full conversation with you so continuing thus you know we could construct the entire set of C characters in Alice's um Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass like including the Mad tea party from the point of view of this color Dimension all right so here's an here's a nice um like a display of Chester Artemis right so this could denote Artemis getting more and more pink as she is actually traveling further into the fourth dimension all right so this is my interpretation of what the chesher cat is doing from a color perspective let's take another example all right here's emis at the beach all right so emis loves the beach one of her favorite pastimes here she is at Big Sir um she has a little sand castle there's this this pronounced foot right in front she's got the snow like the snow the ocean foam and then there's a little dish of coconut oil sitting on the beach right she is totally ecstatic I do have to make one note about um well from 3D this is a joyous experience for em she is is super happy she loves the beach and you know she's saying um so from 3D we can see that Artemis is so happy at the beach she's sitting with her littlea sand castle and her coconut oil everything is fun I do have to make one note people ask me all the time what is it about the coconut oil okay so the coconut oil is a real thing all right so in the middle I have an image of Artemis she has a little dish that I give her this coconut oil on she is ready for the coconut oil in the center right if you look at the image on the right she is in love with the coconut oil right her face like she's just ready for it okay so anytime she's ready she gets a dabble of coconut oil she's asleep and that's the left panel okay so I had to just say that the coconut oil is real she would be this happy at the beach with the coconut oil okay because it is a real thing so from 40 though this image of Artemis at the beach is actually very exciting to analyze so you can definitely still say that Artemis is happy at the beach right while the you know her her snow white fur her fluffy tail and the whiskers have remained in the third dimension since their fourth dimensional W coordinate is zero um but right once again anything pink has wandered off into the Anna Dimension um in the fourth dimension and then the Royal anything royal blue like her eyes and the ocean are now back in the C Dimension so they've wandered off but they're in opposite directions yet she's still here very curious so let's actually start trying to get into a geometric objects all right so one of the most famous objects is the Tesseract right this is well yeah I would say famous but also one of the most simplest VI 40 objects to visualize and we'll see how incredibly difficult this is right away so Charles hinston um has this remarkable um way of actually drawing a tesseract so he says draw two ordinary 3D cubes in 2D space one encompassing the other separated by an unseen distance and then draw lines between their equivalent vertices the eight lines that are connecting the vertices of the two cubes in this case represent a single Direction in the Unseen fourth dimension so the eight lines connecting the vertices represent either the Anna or the cot right the eight lines in totality so this object would not uh be moving like this but since we have a 2d slice of something 4D we use rotation to actually convey what's actually going on in this image okay so from that let's take just a small jump and let's imagine a fourth-dimensional ice cream parlor um so I always play around with this I have this line you know topos Tiger's dream of Looking Glass ice cream I'm I'm enchanted with this um where do you even begin something like that Where Do We Begin well let's start working on the color Dimension right so a point in R4 is a point in R3 with color right all right so four things we know already as a 4D creature has a 3D retina they can see the outside faces in the inside of the ice cream parlor all at once right so Jim's going to pull up some visuals to help us do this the demarcation between inside and outside is something we have here in the third dimension that doesn't really exist there so the ice cream would not be inside the ice cream parlor given that the concept of inside and outside it's not well defined for a 4D creature it's entirely speculative that 40 creatures would consume anything let alone brightly colored ice creams what's the nature of consumption in our 3D World we need a temporal Dimension to make ice cream we assume 4D creatures have their own temporal Dimensions okay so there's lots of assumptions by saying that there is a working ice cream parlor when inside and outside is not so straightforward so where is the mental image of the fourth-dimensional ice cream right so at the beginning of my talk um besides having the um the mini worlds Shana happening and I was hearing the YouTube at the same time at the second beginning of the talk there was um I we walked through a a sort of visualization a visualization about ice cream the ice cream was Dripping right may I ask where was that for you right so we say right I said oh we have this triple stck ice cream cone you can smell the waffle cone right we have cherry chocolate chip pink bubblegum ice cream and where was it do you really have a cone inside your head yet you have a profound mental imagery of that right we're going to talk about that space the topology of that mental imagery space how are you actually able to see that and yet when I push it one more Dimension it seems that that goes away where is the where's the image right so then sometimes okay if you can't quite view it with site maybe you can view it with categorical site right right so I try to go that way all right and come up with something I'm calling functorial ice cream all right so let's see what this would be so I have this idea that pink is a two category that you can represent Cate colors categorically um and so if you consider the category set right where the objects are sets of four tles like XYZ W and the one morphisms are total functions between the sets then perhaps four-dimensional ice cream is a funter um a set value funter that Associates every four tle a color so this is how I imagine functorial um ice cream right so I have a set Valu funter I'm on set and you're like Shanny you bypassed it entirely but you didn't quite visualize it you math magied it and worked around it well this isn't this a visualization but the question is so I can do these beautiful things with Boral ice cream but why why is it so difficult for us to visualize a fourth spatial dimension and more precisely any spatial Dimension higher than three like need I say seven dimensional ice cream at some point it seems like the it won't something will just stop what exactly is the topology of the space of mental imagery most importantly what possible Insight can we gleam from the Fantasia Spectrum particularly hyper Fantasia right so on my side I'm on the hyper Fantasia side of this mental imagery space topology of my mental imy is very complicated um so what can we glean from that on the colorful process of the imagination storage and recall of higher dimensional images what differentiates the you know the shape of my mental imagery space and yours very interesting I think um is it like fantastica does it have a boundary it seems like I've run us up into like a limit Paradox but let's talk about that do we not have enough imagination to visualize fourth-dimensional complexity right well for us that think that being is creation we seem to think that our minds are Limitless right you should be able to imagine anything what does Looking Glass ice cream taste like what does fourth-dimensional ice cream taste like can you taste it if you can't see it and then applying negative thinking well one can ask what came before mental imagery and Imagination so um in private correspondence with Hector manrique and and Michael Walker right so I asked them what how do you actually like from from active inference can you give me an argument as to why why we're stuck why is it that the mental imagery goes off right now I'm going to read this because I think it's very profound and important for the community right so they say sensient creatures create models of the sensed World these generative models are mutable and attune to their specific environments by adaptation by natural selection because of their active exploration and the ensuing capitalization on the sensory feedback that acting upon the world produces in brains that are neurobiological inference machines so our species Homo sapiens and habits a perceptual three-dimensional world and hence the generative models deployed to make sense of visual reality is three-dimensional so making sense of or even mentally representing a 4D visual reality requires generative models that have been selected in response to a sensory 4D world so in their paper they introduced this concept of the zones of bounded surprisal right which roughly refers to the disparity from predictions the surprisal of which is bounded for any given species and correspondingly apprehended by it so plausibly the difficulty of even imagining objects in 40 space May well derive from the outlandish list of matters that fall outside our zbs so we hypothesize that any species like ours that experienced four-dimensional matters often could potentially develop generative models adapted to the sensorium and this register and Visage and imagine such matters because they would fall inside its zbs but however previous exposure to 40 visual stimuli would be required in order to generate the appropriate World models right so pretty much you cannot see it because you have not had uh your generative model um is not plugged into the 40 sensorium we don't have an actual sensor for it right thought that was brilliant that's a possible argument for active inference as to why we can get stuck right well maybe math art can get us to the fourth dimension okay so here we go all right I'm about to send it take to let Jim take over we're going to show you some our Illustrated techniques for visualizing the fourth spatial Dimension we're going to present our ideas of visualizing that and each um iteration has a different conception of what the W coordinate is right so each of the visualization techniques represents a different way of accessing the fourth spatial Dimension we call these concept points okay so for today we're going to discuss concept point one concept point two right and um their animations okay Jim I'll stop sharing so you can take over and then take it away all right thank you shenna let me share my screen um can I see this perfect all right so let me start by asking the question how do we visualize a four dimension spatial system so I want to go back to the ideas of a clim bottle so the clim bottle is a bottle in 4D space whereas when you are walking in any direction um on the exterior surface so the outside eventually you will end up on the inside surface without any collision with any other surface so uh imagine it like a donut so when you are working around the donut you will never touch any surface and end up on the inside of the donut before eventually going on the outside of the donut now also Imagine a mobus strip you're working on the mobia strip and you will eventually end up upside down and that is the idea of a clim bottle so how is it that you are walking on the outside surface and end up on the inside surface how the surface in um something like the left it rtion revolves itself so that you can cross all the surface without cion because clearly you can see here in the 3D space there is a collection of surface and that would be impossible in our current understanding but not now I want you to imagine it in a 4D environment so with we have the 4D environment here the double coordinate represents the positional factor of 40 space on this illustration the blue try to imagine this as a lead bow so the blue represents the outside surface of that bowl and the orange represents the inside surface of that bow if we want something that gets to the inside from the outside um that means you know if you're a person working on that surface when you are moving you know that inside start to get bigger and bigger and bigger while that outside is r in away so something like this could happen but the problem is you can see hey now one surface is on top of each other right there is a collision that's happening but I will get to that point soon so I think what happens is is that um inside and outside is a perspective of simultaneity infinite perspective and that they are both in a inverse proportional relationship so meaning when you are revolving away the outside surface the inside surface will get bigger because you're revolving it towards the perspective and vice versa will happen according to the W Direction it goes so there shouldn't be any Collision that is blocking between the inside and outside perspective unlike you know 3D space where you know you put a book on front of another object it's going to block your line side but that's not going to happen in a 4D space so how do we visualize something like that so that would be the next question I want to ask which is how do we visualize something that have no Collision of inside and outside so I think one way to tuckle this in a 2d illustration is to try to find a perspective that have no blocking of site so try to imagine a tunnel vision so you're going into this infinite tunnel and that you can see every single tunnel wall that is there until infinity and um in order to prevent um inside from colliding with outside I have a illustration here which shows both surface so imagine the blue is the outside of a given object and the orange here is the inside of a given object to prevent them from Collision um let me introduce something called um just the wording Here Local fabric Infinity so what it is represented with the righted lines on the illustration and what it does is um try to imagine it connects every surface every edges of the outside surface towards the inside surface so if you have a Amazon box that you open like open flat out you know you have what um six um six squares right so so of course in 3D space you will say Hey you know one side of this box is not connected to the other side of this box but imagine that when in here um that shape near the infinity is distorted so much that every single edge is connected to every single inner edge of that surface and um in here what it does is um as the surface gets closer to Infinity it gets distorted but as it gets away from Infinity it get less distorted before getting distorted again when it reaches the other side of that Infinity so as the W coordinate moves what will happen is you know let's just say is moving in One Direction the outside surface will start to get compressed while the inside surface will get enlarged and on the second illustration you might say Hey you know there's another blue that's happening in there that was the tunnel effect that I talked about the inner blue circle and the outer blue circle is one is identical so they're both the same uh illustration of that surface it's just a repeated perspective of the surface so as you go through the tunnel what happen is is all the perspective will get compressed to the side if assuming W is moving to One Direction and the the surface that's close closest to the perspective observation point is the one that is less distorted so on the side view I have something to show here what's happening on the top as you can see as we move from left to right you know certain perspective get pushed out and other perspective got enlarged in the middle before being push out again so here is another animation showing what's happening so basically you are going through a tunnel and you know the one that's closest to you will get like less distorted and they will get distorted again and then vice versa if you are going backwards you re reverse W Direction and so yeah to recap um the local fabric Infinity connects the outside surface with the inner surface without collection so that will never be on top of each other there will always be that Infinity there and the double coordinate controls which surface get compressed more or less and now I want to ask the question so we if if that concept is true then how do one perspective see the inside shrink and outside expand at the same time if we put this back into our current understanding of perspective so I think one way to imagine this is to try to imagine it as dual perspective so let's just try to imagine there's two person observing this um the blue sphere right here um try to imagine it have a more thickness of one atom so literally it's one surface like uh it cannot get thinner than that so the the person that's observing the outside of that sphere is looking at the outside surface and the inner inner I mean the other guy is looking at the inner surface and that as the double coordinate changes you know from left to right the outside surface when it gets enlarged the inside perspective of that same surface so remember they're the same surface the blue and the orange will get shrink and the reverse will happen if the W is going to another Direction so to the to each of their own perspective you know one is enlarging another one is shrinking but let me show you animation of that but you know for Dimension perspective um now try to imagine those dual perspective as one perspective so that surface is both shrinking and enlarging at the same time so the double coordinate controls the compression and Distortion so shrinking or enlarging on one identical surface and the inside gets distorted in one perspective and the outside will get compressed in another perspective those two perspective imagine there are one perspective so I think one way to try to imagine this further is to take it to 3D so on the left side the orange sphere um it imagine it is the inside surface of a given object and the right blue sphere is the outside surface of that same given object so you know this will be very straightforward you know on the left it is shrinking and on the right it is expanding right so to their each of own perspective is very easy to understand so what might happen in a 4D space is that both per perspective is happening at the same time so if we compile it it may look something like this so it's shrinking and expanding at the same time and this is only um the concept if assuming we're looking at it from a one origin perspective so that might be what's happening and yeah so to kind of um recap um imagine the fourth dimension as a dual access system we all know that you know threedimensional space you know XY Z but you know four dimensional systems think about X1 y1 Z1 as representing the inside while X2 Y2 Z2 as representing the outside so to each of their own access system you know if one surface is enlar in the other access system is shrinking those system read as one but contain inverse locational properties and thank you very much that's our presentation and it's a very fun topic to discuss and to you shenna thanks so much Jim that was excellent all right so everyone um we have the link our paper is on Phil archive at the moment just a preprint uh we have another home for it um coming up in a couple months and then also so we provided a link this is is going to go to I think Jim's website and so the second link if you want to click on the middle link Jim is just going to take people if people want to go see um like more of those um oh no worries if people want to see um the animations then they they are we just thought they were um like yeah nicely presented and then if you go back to the um the other slide yeah so also we just want to say um in our paper we cover a couple more points um different representations and attempt this sort of 3D retina perspecto path and so we'll say stay tuned for hopefully some more streams on um concept points three four and five we're also going to attempt to visualize the fourth and sixth Dimensions using that beautiful scene from Interstellar um where um Matthew mccon is visiting his daughter he's through the bookcase on one side and you know he turns his head and he's both outside of the room and inside of the room at the same time it's a lovely scene but we think it requires like kind of a six dimensional view but anyway so we want to say thanks so much we hope that was a kind of fun it's a breakfast time we hope it's one impossible thing before breakfast that we can visualize so yeah Daniel any thoughts it was kind of a lot awesome thank you for this very unique double presentation uh for people who are watching feel free to write questions otherwise I mean there's many ways to to add to to the amazing presentation um Jim H how do you connect this with design or how do you see this in relation with design I think um design to me um is a lot of way to let V let people visually understand something because um a lot of times um word by itself might be very hard to understand for um the major audience and I think our job is to bring those part to understand Concepts um for people to understand visually because visually I think um it's always easier for people to see a lot of Concepts yeah I go for I'm not sure there's something to say for like limit Paradox is a design issue or something like when I ask you know to anyone to visualize a fourth spatial Dimension or a negative Dimension right am I asking you to uh visualize a limit Paradox and then perhaps through design it's like if limit Paradox is a design issue then maybe we can work through that or something yeah I'll read a quote just from concept point two imagine there's a dual AIS system the compressed inside has physically been represented in one system and the distorted outside is represented in another system those systems read as one but contain inverse locational properties so I was thinking about the inside and the outside active inference Observer looking at a shared holographic screen and then that screen could be Tic Tac Toe or a cross word in that kind of flat example and then that's where the method of dragging and expanding comes into play well what if that holographic screen had three dimensions four and then there's this interesting relationship with the actual computer science because in that setting sometimes you go okay how about a million dimensional vector and so it contains a lot and then there's all ways to visualize it but then in another sense even the vector with a million Dimensions is still just like one of it being a vector but it's created a simpler handle on that interface to bring it into visuality so you could make just like oh just pass the brackets through and then that is expansive and that is about these that's the aboutness of the data but then from the systems design it's more just like passing a point m yeah I I think so too I'm curious to um hear your thoughts on you know like Hector and Michael's quote about the generative model do you kind of feel the same way can you see yeah it was it was it was a very tasteful quote and I wondered if you had almost even earlier in the presentation presented a counter example which is color so even if the spatial setting like the territory where gravity and friction and these different kinds of phenomena happen whether we think about that with the three XYZ space or whether we think about that in the synergetic setting with the isotropic vector Matrix the close packing spheres however we think about that we're looking at something and we see a color overlay so if we're already in an XYZ plus color worlds I felt like the first part of your presentation was suggesting maybe we have been getting 4D input if we can come to understand our color vision and color vision as a metaphor so I would understand why we might not have intuitions or um evolutionary priors on like gravity in 4D but just the um color brings us basically to the point of a imagining it and then I felt like the major open question or one of them kind of implicitly raised is well then are we generating 4D visual scenery which is the Mind's Eye that is the real Vision so then is that a real 4D input that you could actually build intuition on Andor to what extent is that still just a projection maybe confidence plus projection and you could overlearn essentially anything on this nonvertical geometric thinking well I think that's a nice Crescendo to probably stop at let me ask a Dean question not for the anticlimax um what do the authors think would happen to the concept of fitting when a fourth dimension is introduced which fits which oh can can you elaborate a little bit what what fitting like a little bit more about what that means uh it just says what do the authors think would happen to the concept of fitting when a fourth dimension is introduced which fits which in out in out maybe if he types more we can see um where do you both go from this work and having seen it and done it this way like Jim first um I think um sh sh do you have like a idea for that oh yeah so you want to maybe talk about how we were talking about uh if you lay down fourth dimension as you know um trying to parameterize inside outside coordinate and mess with that um we had some thoughts about what you thought possibly like is there a fifth dimensional coordinate that you can sort of uh play with um is there a sixth dimensional coordinate so do you want to share maybe some of your ideas about the Tesseract that we thought you could manipulate that you needed a higher dimension for that oh yeah yeah yeah so um I think um because right now we're only um talking about locational properties um like basically physical properties we haven't touched on anything like for example like time and you know all those other stuff yet so um some ideas maybe for like higher Dimension is you know um like if there's like um collision and non-collision with different system because right now we have no Collision um as a for um First Dimension concept but um could there be a factor just controlling those C you know higher degree system and um even I would say um we have some ideas about kind of um inducting P how perspective would evolve as I mention gets higher and higher so we know um in in a 1D system you know it's a point point so so we don't like for for a perspective there's no line of sight right there's only like a point also for perspective and once we get to a 2d system um it's a line so now we have a a a range of site but we don't have any other like like um 3D capability in that system and you know 3D system we know we have like a range and we have a domain but um for the perspective and it originate from one point of perspective so we are seeing that you know um from one point origin and you know 4D you know our idea was like um we have multiple ideas um like the Dual perspective we talked about we also have a a sphere perspective that we haven't talked about yet um we're still working on that but um basically um it tells how you know how do we um how do the perspective work if it is in a 3D origin so basically it is you a sphere of influence instead of one point of origin and uh how would the range domain you know and all other stuff works um to include so maybe you know in that space the XYZ now is like wraps around everything and it wraps around three dimensionally together and um so maybe you know once we get to to um higher Dimension that sphere would become you know like um a a 4D perspective you know 5D system like now you get inside outside of that perspective of of the 5D system so maybe you know like this is just U induction thinking of what's the next time maybe but yeah there are a lot of ideas there that we haven't really you know land on you know which one to do yet but definitely kind of like Jim said following up on this uh 3D retinol perspective so that's going to take a lot of imagination to think that so I agree with Daniel that we do have this color overlays that like flirtations of fourth dimension like what is that but uh we definitely don't have a 3D retina at the moment and so trying to Broach that we think taking what we call the uh you know in dimensional retinal path and then seeing what can imagine like based on that so it's uh we think it'll be fruitful that's awesome it also makes me think about using color change the way that Artemis was the uh dropa for showing color change and then it's like well that's not really showing it it's like but what is that and then exploring well why does it have to be a certain way it's like okay well drawing only means lines on the plane okay but then you already know what the whole Space of what you could draw is and so maybe you could draw something flat but then you would say it's just this lower Dimension anyway even if it were drawn so then the color is just a suggestion about how to move into another way but but also not clearly not being a geometric Dimension so then it's like even just a just a symbol of of generalizations of colors um Dean wrote glove fits hand hand fits glove in the fourth dimension how how in the fourth dimension does how we explain fit with examples still hold glove over and around hand and hand over and around glove would still be available in the fourth dimension perspective question mark do 4D hands fit 4D gloves that's a great thank you de that question is yeah is that is that all right if if the 4D hand must be inside the 4D glove then I would say no right but if there's a a new way of fitting that does not have a demarcation of inside outside um then yeah you definitely have a a four-dimensional clothing line what do you think Jim yeah I think I think if you come move around inside and outside then technically you know there's no anything that's wrapping around another stuff but that can be changed though if we are talking about two individual items that doesn't interact with each other if one's inside another one's outside then sure there can be a 40 glov interesting that made me think of like a mobia strip scarf but it's not around you you could be just set you're not knotted up with that scarf but it could be hard to pull off okay that's yeah good clothing line next thank you well what is g to come up in math art shenana yeah so we are having um we are gonna start writing just a couple papers about what uh trying to figure out what math art is so we're going to try to actually flush that out and then we're going to have some deep Dives featuring Daniel and um kinsky and then um Blake and then um Hector and I will be doing um um magic in the free energy principle so we think there's something with the patronum charm and um and Fe and surprisal that's just like waiting so that's G to be um um like coming up we can't wait Jim any last words yeah I think this is a such fun topic we had a lot of fun talking about this and you know because right now this is all concept I feel you know we can bring a lot more that ideas to people hopefully Inspire others awesome thank you both awesome works so see you next time
