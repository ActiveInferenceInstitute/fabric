**Refined Text:**

This is the Math Art Stream 8, scheduled for September 6, 2024, focusing on William Blake, "Kard," and Gothic art. I will commence with an introductory presentation, followed by Shanon's brief presentation, after which we will engage with live chats and discussions. In this session, we will explore the interplay between William Blake's active inference, mathematics, and art within a four-fold unity—a theme we will revisit multiple times. The presentation slides are available for download on Zenodo.

We will begin with a brief introduction to fractals and their relevance to Blake's work, followed by a discussion on his perspectives regarding art and his various creations. We will also examine the connections between Blake, mathematics, and science, culminating in a consideration of Blake's possible insights into active inference. It is important to note that since Blake passed away in 1827, he did not use contemporary terminology or concepts; however, this discrepancy adds an intriguing layer to our exploration.

As we structure this linear live stream, it is essential to address how to justify our introduction and provide a representative sample of Blake's extensive body of work. We will question the definitions of art and mathematics, exploring whether these concepts are procedural or outcome-oriented. We will also consider the notions of self-recognition and recognition of others, as well as the distinctions between various forms of art and mathematics. The investigation will encompass the nature of intention in artistic creation.

Focusing on Blake's oeuvre, we will begin with widely discussed aspects before moving to lesser-explored territories. Numerous biographies and scholarly resources are available for further insight into Blake's artistic contributions, such as the Blake Society and the Blake Archive, alongside previous streams that explored connections between Blake and Buckminster Fuller.

Shanon suggested that we delve into the third non-party of the Gothic, which sparked excitement upon discovering various publications such as "William Blake’s Gothic Imagination" and "Gothicism and Romanticism in William Blake." One of Blake's notable statements, "Grecian is mathematical form; Gothic is living form," invites us to examine Gothic figures and architecture without preconceived notions of historical periods. 

To reduce uncertainty regarding the Gothic, I pose the question: What constitutes the Gothic? How can we contextualize Blake's work within this genre? Is it merely a historical period or an aesthetic sensibility? Hector and I engaged in a preliminary discussion on this topic, and I invite you to share your thoughts.

Hector, would you like to begin?

[Hector responds, discussing the challenges in defining Gothic art and its historical context.]

Shanon, do you have any insights to add?

[Shanon shares her interpretations of Gothic art, linking it to Blake's themes of darkness and introspection.]

Moving on to the intersection of Blake, art, and science, we find that the term "fourfold" appears frequently in Blake's poetry, reflecting his preference for this concept. A notable example is found in his correspondence with Thomas Butts, where he describes a progression from single vision to more complex forms of vision. This approach prompts us to consider how Blake perceives mathematics and science, particularly through the lens of his fourfold vision. 

Blake's artistic methodology often contrasts with the rigid structures associated with Newtonian science. He criticizes overly precise delineation in art, advocating for a more fluid and organic approach. This tension between art and science raises questions about the nature of discovery and the role of artistic intuition in scientific advancement.

In our exploration of mathematics and science, we will examine Blake's resolution to the perceived conflict between these fields. Contrary to the notion that Blake held anti-scientific views, this discussion reveals a nuanced relationship where art can indeed instruct science. We will also touch upon recent scholarly discussions regarding Blake as a biological visionary, emphasizing his belief that nature lacks strict delineation.

As we transition into the active inference section, I invite comments and reflections on these topics before we move forward.

[The discussion continues with participants sharing their insights and engaging with Blake's themes.]
