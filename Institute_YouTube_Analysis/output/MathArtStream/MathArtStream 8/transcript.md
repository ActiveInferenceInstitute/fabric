all right this is math art stream 8 on September 6 2024 on William Blake kard and the gothic I'll give a presentation to begin this stream then shanon will follow with a second short presentation and then we'll read live chats and discuss so here we see William Blake active inference and math and art in this kind of four-fold unity and it's going to be a theme that's returned to many times the slides are published and downloadable on zenodo here so in this stream presentation we're going to start with the little fractal nan. why and what might Blake have to do with any of this then head around some of the edges on the T through Blake a view on Blake's view on Art and some of his work then on to Blake and Math and Science and then at the last part go into possibilities for Blake and active inference of course given that Blake passes away in 1827 it's not that he's going to exactly use the same words or concepts and have different understandings than we have now but that's part of the fun okay so for the dot zero in thinking about how to structure what could be done within a short linear live stream and just how to even justify the introduction and to sample let alone biasedly from how much work Blake did and then how many thousands of Latter works and so then it was like well what is art what is math what is math art is it procedural is it about an outcome what about recognizing of oneself what about recognition of another are there art or Arts math or maths what makes it sometimes or always or never is it a media or is it about an intention so all these different features and then just on the Blake side how to even enter into the spinning of the Blake Ted when there's so many different Avenues so starting with what has been most discussed and then moving towards what has been lesser discussed Blake's life and work have been reviewed there's many biographies written and a lot of scholarship so to see more about Blake's artistic contributions etchings and so on there are great resources like Blake Society Blake archive a lot of other scholarship and some previous streams that focused more on the ju deposition of Blake and Buckminster Fuller's life so enough said on Blake's art and life in general shanana suggested for this stream the third non-party of the gothic and so even a cursory search was very exciting to see like a book William Blake's Gothic imagination Blake in the gothic gothicism and Romanticism in William Blake and then one of Blake's kind of most pithy and famous things Grecian is mathematic form Gothic is living form and then let them look at Gothic figures and Gothic buildings and not talk of Dark Ages or of any age so for my and everyone's uncertainty reduction shanana what is the gothic and Hector and anyone else but what is the gothic how would people even set up to call Blake's work Gothic is it like a historical period or a Vibe or what is the gothic Hector you and I were talking about that right um do you like you take it first and then I'll follow you what you thought I no thoughts about this well I mean I guess he breaks with the tradition of looking to the classics and he has this kind of figures that are dark and that makes it gotic but to tell you the truth I'm not sure when exactly gotic appears in in in arts which is the period would Associated more toward the 19th century and bl is from 18th century so I mean I don't know if you have any ideas I hav't exp this yeah for me Daniel is like um you know Gothic is this like um it's not this like lofty scholarly indifference it's this very nightmarish um introspection and so like uh my definition of or not the way that I interpret that which is why I threw kard in here is that uh the only way out is in and so they're going that's what I think goth is that he has he doesn't care how uh like dark what he's doing um is something like that so like a the darkest reflection is what he's going for and through that you get individuality earnestness and subjectivity that's what I thought awesome interesting yeah let's continue to return to it but it's just interesting that he used the term and that others have explored some of those connections okay Blake and Art and Science so again another great topic where also many have explored and so I'll try to to juxtapose what mostly other people have done so the word fourfold or fourfold appears many times in Blake's longer poems and is clearly one of his favorite Expressions probably the best known example occurs in his letter to Thomas buts and here's this short set of lines that describe a four-fold three-fold two-fold and single Vision so in thinking at a really first pass how is Blake approaching Math and Science one way to enter that is the four-fold vision which reflects the Supreme total vision is one way that you can then strip and reduce down to what he calls single vision and Newton sleep so here's like Newton the geometer so this is active geometry but then there's a whole another sense in which technique with constructed consistency like formal systems symbolic systems programming these techniques are like mono perspectival single Visions like through a telescope or a microscope and that relates also to like incompleteness and the sleep of experience so 4old vision is this synoptic panoptic not that that these any of these given adjectives like are what Blake or what you know even correct I'm just saying one way of seeing it it reduces down to all of technique and I think another interesting comparison here from our uh 4D histories are we have works of art like kandinsky's point and line to plane which is a conventional constructivist approach to building up dimensionalities like Zero Dimensional or onedimensional Point like whether you think about a point as being Zero Dimensional or a point as being described by just one number so like one dimensional data structure one two three point line plane and then you get to the space en closing T however in the geometry of lumps which we explored a little bit in synergetics and the 4D stream Al also though the growth and de site and Shana's work with diamonds and everything there's a composite one and that's resonating with Blakes four Mighty ones are in every man so here we have four as one rather than 1 2 3 4 four as one and one as four and then another funny thing just in the searching this is a department of vascular surgery presidential address single vision and Newton sleep and so just some of the many many ways that people take even a image or a subimage from Blake and then that is like inspirational okay more on Blake in math and science here's Blake's resolution to the war between science and philosophy this article discusses how Blake is often unfairly characterized as holding anti-scientific views or sentiment however it isn't really like that can art instruct science William Blake as biological Visionary Nature has no outline there's going to be a tension with delineation because on one hand the great and Golden Rule of art as well of as well as of life is this that the more distinct sharp and wiry the bounding line the more perfect the work of art and he across his whole career letters Works everything is just always like disparaging and clowning on more diffuse Artistic Styles and kind of seeking for this Precision of the etch and that's traced out in fibers globul cells leading even really recently continued discussion on how ways of seeing like single on through higher Visions can precede scientific discoveries Paradigm shifts all those kinds of topics and then one last slide on the math and science side here in the active infer ants repo is a short program where you can enter in the search terms and then it'll pull out the three lines before and the three lines after the term is mentioned so like system math science space Time Eternity just kind of a fun method not AI unless you think of this already as AI but it's just a way to pull out like a search this is just an indexing but it's just one little Nano operation okay any comments or thoughts before we head into the active inference section okay all right so here as as so symbolically with a limited time to prepare for a creative request from shanana how to even convey what can we do again in just a few minutes quote minutes that also is going to be something broader so here's the four as one double double questions of four as one coming through the Blake forence Edge four slides that will be perceived in a different other way okay so starting in this first Edge defraction Blake and the particular partition previously we saw a foress related to ways of knowing SL states of being like Newton's sleep as a single Vision there are many other aspects and four-fold concordances in Blake for example tetrahedral pneumonics are used verbatim and structurally to summarize systems physical and cognitive systems in terms of this unified while compositional geometric and topological structure so how could this connect with another four-fold partition the particular partition in free energy principle and other types of fourfold systems and especially thinking about systems with systems systems in systems systems within and without systems this nested gear the Mills and the factory all these different ways that Blake revisits and kind of looks upon the brain and the body and the technique so from Frist in 2019 free energy principle for a particular physics which in some ways kicked off uh first principles Direction and advances in FP and actm lays out this concept of the particular partition it's a bit of a pun because particular can mean that one like that certain particular style which it is a defined one and not the only one but a particular one and it particularizes which makes agentic or dissolves what agency or agent is or makes an agent of everything making it that description of that specific thing using a scale-free framework so then further work like the path integrals particular kind uh strange particles continues to develop okay how about particular kinds what are those different kinds of things and then uh particularity comes up all the time in Blake also with that ambiguity but for example art and science cannot exist but in minutely organized particulars it's like what is the general generalization of physiology could there even be or if it could be would it do what physiology is it's like physiology is the minute particulars it's how it really is organized not only that also more but it is really minute particulars if you didn't have them it wouldn't be there so there's a sense in which like anything that excludes the minute particulars through generalization that is like again kind of in the sleep of generalization and then here's another kind of interesting thing seeing this four to four and a half to five overlap shape this one made by Blake with these symbolic characters that are used in like very like complex ways and then here's Milton's track in his poetic epic Milton coming in through the party of Satan as Blake said it and then finding you know into these different overlaps and then here's an interesting uh dissertation William Blake and systems theory the attempted unification of history and psychology so just there there's so many cool works on these different aspects so that's one first point on Blake and active inference which is particularizing thing that being related to a four-fold distinction and a Unity 4 in one one in four those are some very foundational uh touch points okay but into the second area Blake and cognition so here thinking about cognition as perception cognition action like the agents in the niche outside of the four-fold partition only and then like Niche extension all this so was William Blake the first neuroscientist by Ian molist in 2015 very interesting for those who are following along with Neuroscience to see that this is now almost 10 years ago just a Blog and sure Miguel Christ was was aware and thinking of this before and others but these connections with Blake and cognition are fascinating and there's so many ways that they get taken here's more recent Blake and the mark of the cognitive notes towards the appearance of a skeptical subject William Blake's integral psychology reading Blake and Ken Wilbur together William Blake and the metaverse the mental fight to be a person one of the most famous references from literat is if the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is infinite from Marriage of Heaven and Hell doors of perception goes on to be Aldis huxley's book by that name from out the portals of my brain William Blake's partis mentis and the imaginative regeneration partis mentis the paration of the mind so here a mirror uh or close pun playay not a partition but a birth of the Mind brings together following two aspects of romantic culture and ideology the exploration into human generation and the process of how imagination forms an idea and makes the Mind creatively productive this article suggests that analyzing William Blake's portrayal of imagination through the partus menst Trope can enhance our comprehension of how he illustrates and employs the faculty in his Works opening the doors of perception using William Blake's writings to enhance student understanding of cognition so now we're getting into like this is the cognitive Science Education math art Fusion doors of perception passage could also provide an opening to discuss the information processing model of human memory these are like not dissimilar it's just oh there's numbers in that Cube It's a matrix here's an ACM model some interesting connections with mcluhan and Blake if perceptive organs vary objects of perception seem to vary if the perceptive organs close their objects seem to close also in the universe there are things that are known and things that are unknown and in between there are doors so earlier there was a line as blanket blanket as line and then here blanket as door does the marov blanket separate or does it connect does an interface separate or connect uh security blanket security door the locking the blanket man has no body distinct from his soul for that called body is a portion of a soul discerned by the five senses the chief inlets of soul in this age so just so many on and the the searching for the cognitive terms actim onology terms there's a ton okay this is this is the last of the prepared for so here just one physical book that of of Blake scholarship reading in preparation for this uh stream was narrative Unbound revisioning William Blakes the four zoas by Donald alt so here are some pictures from this book so we have nested diagrammatic representation and then it reminded Ed me of some other diagrams I had seen like these and just about how there are structural and multiple readings and writings especially when looking through the archives and the marginalia we can see the revision of Blake's Works some that were never published ones that are surely lost ones that it's unknown how they're lost different versions that complicate any even s singular linearization of a text because just oh well there's these three pressings but the ordering is different and then yet there's so much structural narrative work so but because again there's so many cool papers so this one but jumped out for for first the structural uh meta category theoretic approach which I believe is reflected in these excellent un corn related books and in uh Blake analysis so here's why I followed up on this one book though other than these great pictures here so on the quote left side this is a mirror and a carpet so here's page 10 of narrative Unbound actm book for reference here's okay then flip into just the left side so it's like okay I'm seeing the page in the mirror and then on that page okay the narrative comment from Donald alt is the possibility that the forzo narrative will be denied existence by the resist of reader and then the quote from the text any reader who is able to perceive the text as though it were itself undergoing transformation dissolving fixed facts in the receding narrative and allowing the past to be reenacted and revised has already been initiated into Blake's perspective drama and then another person wrote actually on the side agree but why go on and then there were these other complexities later in the book with other pens and other people making annotations so it's just like showed how this structural information of the text and the way that it rules out the existence of a pre-fabricated world that acts as a mysterious substratum of the text perspective transformation argues that whatever underlying world or deep structure the poem could possibly exhibit must come into existence uh in the process of being narrative and then meta editorial comments again from the author on his own writing just the quotes from the side deep structures are misnomers of unstable structures the this relates to hierarchical depth do biological systems have a tremendous chandelier like hierarchical depth Andor are they heterarchical and quote shallow but happening like all in memory so it doesn't require hierarchies that would be spatially instantiated perspective transformation operates on itself retroactive finally okay on page 10 of the book word finally retroactive and projective perspective Transformations are structurally self-reflexive they operate not only on narrative details but also on themselves by their very nature perspective Transformations have the power to modify the rules of the game at those junctures where the context The Narrative reaches a state of Crisis and then here's how that comes up in the work and then the last comment self-reflexivity of perspective transformation produces narrative branching as if to subvert this emergence into consciousness of its own unconscious process so that relates to this tension is Blake's systemization of scenario and mind yet another sleep to fall into another deeper more sophisticated system that also constrains the narrative begins generating branching alternative routes through which conflicting narrative possibil ities of Prior events are realized perspective transformation itself under goes transformation by not only analyzing prior events but also simultaneously generating different and irreducibly incom measurable ways the same event actually happens enters into the narrative so just line by line in the Blake scholarship and text there are amazing things so Dean and then anyone else and then we'll go to Shana's presentation well um I'm not sure if I'm gonna add anything really interesting to that thanks for the for the outline one thing I'm I'm really interested in maybe Dan you've got some insight on this it seems to me like Blake wrote this stuff about 200 years ago is that about right yes writings 17 57 to 1827 okay there we go so obviously he was able to come up with something that still resonates with people 200 years later and I would I would I would think that that tells us something about who we are as readers of his work what do you think was the sort of insight that he had that whatever he was writing would continue to resonate and continue to motivate people to investigate I think his own life gives a wide range of interpretations from again manuscripts that were lost but then the insertion of historical characters in his own work and then them saying things like don't worry nothing was lost like it's all good with what we have and then works that were made in one copy or several copies so kind of a view that the work was and he was working so physically on the materials that it's almost like his own uncertainties or views on those questions which now we could ask and wonder about were being sublimated into his process and his existential livelihood as an artist so do you think from from the is is there a like a direct tie in to the way that he actively inferred that is actually maybe representative of the kind of scale-free over over hundreds of years a window that that maybe others who've written don't necessarily carry that through their work it's it's an interesting question I think again to the ways of working when there are a very limited amount of documents available like physically or also the digitizations which are catching up in again the amazing work of the Blake archival communities so when there's few and multiple interpretations that's like in a way the few and multiple code versions or manuscript versions that might exist in a research project and so it gives a multiplicity to the work which again is another structural element that's almost like whether the words or the images are things you want to look at there are structur structural transfers that um having even a sample of his letters intermediates and notes give another view that that's also redoubled in the work or gives like but or confused with the work or anything like that but just gives some possible multiple reading thanks Shana your presentation and then we'll all right let's do that so you think that these have nothing to do but I love this um systems within systems let me show this you see this okay you see my screen okay yep go for it all right so um I'm curious to see especially Dean's questions to Daniel if he's actually translate over um fard almost had it equally sort of tricky um no publicist or editor and once again these people that are sort of writing to no one yet kard is using these pseudonyms so in the same vein of um systems within systems uh if the doors of perceptions were cleansed everything um would appear as it is infinite I want to take us through just a couple powerful quotes on KAG guard's side he's going to invoke this concept like I was saying earlier the only way out is in powerful Works powerful thinker and he says he's going to bring up this concept of despair uh which is not really what you think it is it's a kind of self interpretation of this and he says uh eternity is obliged to do this this is going to refer to this despair uh how eternity handles Despair and he says because to have a self to be a self is the greatest concession and infinite concession given to man but it was also eternity's claim upon him so kard is um a little bit later than Blake there is an overlap uh but from 18 this you know his life is from 18 35- 1855 writing most of the things that I resonate with in 1840 so K just a little bit about him um is a he's an incredible Danish Theologian social critic philosopher poet um and possibly like if people are considering Blake the first neurologist then you know the first they would consider Kar the first existential philosopher various schools have thought that some of his writings have influenced um our existentialism Continental philosophy which we have an exciting stream coming up um in existential psychology so some of the collections of works that are very very powerful um this is not by any means exhaustive are either or philosophical fragments fear and trembling um and sickness unto death which is um a beautiful like Exposition for upbuilding and Awakening and so the systems within systems Kar might be one of the first to question like um what is a self and so I I my admiration for kard is that um there's several quotes that the wiki like there's Stamford encyclopedia has great articles on a great like summary of kard and Wiki does too and um what I really like is that he says science and you know scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way and so while scientists are talking about like observation kard is actually emphatically denying that external observation alone is going to get the inner workings of the world this seems very Blakey into me that becoming subjective is the way and so uh what I like is that in a lot of his works you know um he always has these very powerful intros and these are very like I just feel like they're they're writing from the same space trying to get to someone so kard will open this book by saying many may find the form of this Exposition strange it may seem to them too rigorous to be up building and too up building to be rigorously scholarly as far as the latter is concerned I have no opinion as to the former I beg to differ what I like about him is that um so he he's weary of what he calls the loftiness of indifferent knowledge it's a long way from being more Earnest and he's saying that the loftiness is like this witticism and affectation and it's actually earnestness is the upbuilding so everything ought to serve for upbuilding and that and that it's actually this concern that constitutes the relation to life uh to the actuality of the personality effort to earnestness and I admire this a lot um in my like recent work with um like Hector and um Michael Walker and what I really admire about them and a lot of people in the actor infant Community is that like um powerfully individualistic and powerfully like about the earnestness um and I I really I I I've learned a lot from these um thinkers and researchers that you know um that it's through it's through like concern and it's through your own interior and it's it's like it's through the inside that you're going to be looking and I I really value that um in my colleagues and so um just to say a little bit about where K card's writing from and then go into the self because the self of the self or the self it's his writing is very very powerful and I think we have the minds in here just to sort of decipher the systems going on so Kar is kind of like writing in the dark he has no publicist he has like no editor and he he has no idea who's reading his books and I think there's something beautiful about that um so once again he's sort of like grath and deque doing these like powerful epies to no one and he's invoking these pseudonyms at the same time so he says uh what I've understood is the task of the authorship has been done it is one idea this continuity from either or to anti-climacus the idea of religiousness and reflection the task has occupied me totally for it has occupied me religiously I've understood the completion of this authorship is my duty is my responsibility resting upon me um so sort of like this calling uh which I think Blake has the same it's almost like an inability to not uh write these things so he advises readers to read his book slowly and even aloud that he might a it as understanding but yet you see he's uh he's very on the fence about not being indifferent about it but actually learning towards the inside and so he says who has the more difficult task the teacher who lectures on Earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life or the learner who should put it to use right and and so there's a nice quote here um about kard not denying the validity of abstract thinking but he's saying that just abstract thinking is never actually going to get you um the power of like understanding human existence and so I like that he says to be human means to be concrete to be this person here and now in this particular and decisive moment uh face to face with this particular challenge so I find this like ripe for active inference um um yeah in the couple of the following ways okay so here we go so his first couple lines uh in this this book a very light title The Sickness unto death right I'm sorry I've read this like so many times because something in it called to me the same thing that Blake Blake's nightmares are calling to people and so I find this so powerful if you can untangle it so he says what is the self um and this why I see such a parallel here between what Daniel showed earlier about perspective Transformations operating on themselves right and also systems Within systems so what is a self um looking towards a reflection and introspection so K says the following a human being is Spirit but what is spirit Spirit is the self what is the self the self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relations relating itself to itself in the relation the self is not the relation but is a relations relating itself to itself okay I'm I don't know you're going to see that I'm going to relate this to kind of like category Theory stuff because it seems like these are incredible morphisms so human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite of the temporal and the Eternal a freedom and necessity in short a synthesis like Daniel was saying four is one one is four a synthesis is a relation between two but considered in this way human being is still not a self right the self again is not it's the relations it's the relating itself to itself right so he keeps going there couple paragraphs and I'll just highlight some things so he says in the relation between the two the relation is the third is a negative unity and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation so thus under the qualification of the psychical relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation if however the relation relates itself to itself this relation is the positive third and this is the self right so he says such a relation that relates itself to itself as self must either have established itself or been established by another okay self-established where the self is the relation to the relation and so if for relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another and the relation is indeed the third but this relation the third is yet again a relation relates itself to that which establishes the entire relation I don't think you get this sort of line of inquiry PR kard so he's always talking about the power of being alone being alone with your own reflection before reflection um and I definitely think this is what Blake is after sort of the the same thing maybe kard is formalizing in just a little bit so here comes the despair line which kard is famous for formalizing um the human self he says is as such a derived established relation a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another this is why there can be two forms of Despair he says in the strict sense right so he's saying if the if the if the human self had it self-established there could only be one form and the first form he says is not to will to be on self to will to do away with oneself right that's like uh you know everybody struggles with that I wish I wish I was not myself I wish I could just be Daniel today how amazing would that be right these sort of gentle things that he's really gonna go into what does that mean for shanana to say I wish I could be Daniel today right I wish I could be Hector tomorrow and maybe Dean on Monday like what does that mean he's going to really tackle that second form of Despair is in despair to will to be oneself right in despair I am myself I promise I'm myself it's me and you're not really yourself I'm acting like Hector but I want to be myself right I think he's he's he's tackling this so brilliantly because everybody has those thoughts and he follows them and he follows them how they relate with themselves so he has this complete dependence of the relation of the self the expression for the inability of the self to arrive at or to be in equilibrium and rest by itself but only in relating itself to itself relating itself to that which has established the entire relation this doesn't sound like a strange Loop I'm not sure right I'm not sure what else could so he says the Mis relation of Despair is not a simple Mis relation but a Mis relation in a relation that relates itself to itself and it has been established by another so we have another layer system there that the Mis relation in that relation which is for itself also reflects itself infinitely in the relation to the power that established it infinite reflection you know showed this on like five slides ago so um we Hector uh we and IIs we just did this beautiful stream on animagus and I'm thinking animagus self animagus self what is this self like where does the math art come into this this is all math art where is the where is the like uh the relation the infinite reflection inside something like a complete metamorphosis where is the self line um Chris fieldon I've always looked at this continuity over time continuity of self like I talked about the despair of the butterfly does the butterfly have these two types of Despair when I said I remember I was a caterpillar inching along that tree plump and Squishy and we did this like the butterfly remembered being a caterpillar right this is very I think this is like beautiful what is a self right so I'm going to take a crack at this and I I really think and let me know if anybody sees this that yita limma is one of the most powerful Limas in category Theory which is actually pulling together morphisms between morphisms and morphisms so kard what if we could mathematize the relation you're looking at I love that he's saying relation of relation but I thought you might as well just put like a geometry on that relation what if you put a structure on it why don't you enrich that relation right and you can get kard as a Unita liit is that a fractal relation the self relates itself to itself he stops at the positive third but could you keep going is there a positive fourth right in that system of infinite Reflections how far can you keep going is it something profinite is it something oniric so currently um Hector and Michael Walker and I are working on like like beautiful um ideas about the oniric self what is that the dream self right can you actually does K guard's like Reflections here would they actually stay in something like a dream self or do these infinite Reflections mess up the waking self which self is he actually talking about right so you can do the thing about self and representability and again if you remember a Prof finite set I've talked about this a couple streams ago compact H St the scary thing it's totally disconnected right the only connected components are the dot the Singleton um kard self is y need alone right so you can have this thing where I have a nonfractal identity it's me it's shanana looking in the mirror and seeing someone amazing right oh I wish I could be that one day right but I'm really on the left side because you know we all have thoughts like that and so but the fractal the fractal self I've said this before maybe fractal I begs fractal me right so Cinderella is already fractal that's why I'm saying if you could really analyze the cure cardian self relation but that that relation relating itself to itself what if that was a fractal what was that I think if you infuse that sort of mathematization into C Guardian thing what would actually happen right so just to get to the onita Lima and I'll go quick um there's things called you know that I've things mathematical objects very beautiful called representable funs right so you have an object in a category you can consider the totality of the maps out of the object right so as liner said you know um category theories about objects so many objects and they all see and so the site is actually the arrows out of it right so to each object there's a sign the set of maps um from a to that object okay and so you can construct this object this functor h superscript a which is going to be um the set the set of set or class of maps from a um so you start at a and all the maps out of a you can also do a functor with all the maps into a and so you're going to say that a functor is actually representable if x is isomorphic to something that looks like H to the a right and so um yita is actually doing I think what kard is doing so the onma you have the Dual of ofh of a and so these are actually going to be Maps into a and so um if we actually talk about um this definition 1.25 where you have a category and you have a pre- on a on the category a the locally small category being a funter from a op into set and so uh for each object in a you have a representable preep all these words are awesome the question is um if you have another preep does that look from ha so we're actually asking what are all the maps like what do representa see and so yita I think is really encapsulating um kards the self of a self of a self the sort of relation relation relation because for Unita you have um the category a you have the category set and so I have one functor one h of a like mapping so just a fun between categories but I can also fix another object and I can have another h a and so I actually am trying to find the if the relation is relating itself to itself then you can see that maybe what Kart saying is the self is a natural transformation the self is the relation between itself and itself right so I think it's so fun to um so informally the UNM is going to say for any a and a and pre- sheep x on a a natural transformation so this is a map between functors so again you can have category a uh category set I have have one funter ha and then I have another fixed object and I have another ha and I map between them and that yma is actually an element of the set XA and so a is a locally small category we say it very beautifully we say the set of natural Transformations is actually going to be um of the form X of a for that funter category and so it's kind of fun you can think about like Daniel was showing it's so like the mirror uh Daniel side on the mirror is so like I've done this work on diamonds and you know Diamond it's like what would profinite see right so when you have these infinite Reflections self within self system within system perspective Transformations operating on themselves um what would Pro finite Reflections look like and so I love this taking this idea everyone's using the term relation uh perspective like transer like operating on itself and what if you sort of mathematize that and just give it a little extra structure right so profinite reflections of impurity what would that look like you needa is going to answer the question what do these representable functors see and then likewise we can ask what does profite see so um you can also I've said this like you can also think about color categorically and um you know that profite Reflections have these categoric colors okay so again if kard is this y yemma um I just think that's very cool so you can actually encapsulate self relations as particular like fun categories you know okay couple thoughts on Despair and I'll stop all right so uh what he calls despair it's not just like oh I'm sad but he actually sort of um will take the line of Despair and go and he says the formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out as this in relating itself to itself and willing to be itself the self- rest transparently and the power that establish should so he says a despair an Excellence or a defect well purely dialectically he says it is both if only the abstract idea of Despair is considered without any thought of someone in despair must be regarded as surpassing Excellence so there's this you have the possibility of this sickness which he's going to call he's going to call despair sickness you're aware of it and then you can be cured and that's going to be the expositional up um like uplifting so he says consequently to be to be able to despair is an infinite advantage and yet to be in despair is not only the worst Misfortune and misery no it is ruination generally it's not the case with the relation between possibility and actuality and he says if it is an Excellence to be able to be this or that it's an even greater Excellence to be that in other words to be is like an Ascent when compared with being able to and with respect to despair however to be is like a descent when compared with uh no so I just said the same thing The Descent is as infinitely low as the Excellence of possibility is high so I like that right uh that the the ability to be able to so it means something is messed up in the sort of the natural transformation line okay and so he says um so again the despair is not attributable to the Mis relation but to the relation that relates itself to itself a person cannot rid himself of the relation to himself anymore than he can rid himself of his which after all is one and the same thing he says since the self is the relation to oneself okay that's the tricky thing so the self is that natural transformation I think and then you need yeah totally off but I think it's kind of cool to visualize it though back and that so that's going to book in that initial uh um quote that it began with eternity is obliged to do this because to have a self to be a self is the greatest concession an infinite concession given to man but it's also eternity's claim upon him I love that you're not going to be able to rid yourself of that self and you're either with that or it's Despair and so he says the despair isn't going to be interpreted as a sickness not actually a cure and despair is that dialectical he says very powerful writing um many other like thinkers like present thinkers have taken the same line of thought and aart talks about it all the time aart is amazing says um uh one of his when he says you asking about his inlightened State he makes videos about this he says well I start having these thoughts I canot I cannot live with myself right meaning you're upset with you he goes wait there at least two people in that statement and so this is letter like a is saying the self was the relation to oneself I thought H this is this is ripe stuff for an upcoming like a Delian Halloween stream because who's what is this you know and then you wear and what's nice about kard is that he's making this even more strange with pseudonyms I'm going to put a pseudonym which is sort of in the front maybe a misnomer uh about the depth of actually what's going on and I'm G to have pseudonyms relating the self to the self you see right so it's like ah the pseudonym of functorial ice cream maybe this is what I really want to be so maybe the functorial ice cream is the is the pseudonym so anyway I was thinking hey self is representability despair is as surprisal uh C kard blanket categorical despair you know so that's why I thought um categorical gothicism is sort of like you know little duck rabbits running around but they're not duck rabbits they're kirar Blakes running around everywhere and then you have this uh onir S as representability um people have told me Daniel there's and I'm sure you could find it anyone can find it during the stream there's like a there's lots of Duck Rabbit shirts that have like they're charted on like 2D axes like Duck Rabbit and we can make like a character guard Blake shirt um out of absolute respect because these guys are very powerful um you know yeah and so looking forward to like establishing more of this oniric self so that's sort of where I was getting Hector in this work like when what does the dream solve like what does that actually look like you know I think that's all I have okay cool and that's all I have on that one awesome any thoughts thank you Shana anyone in the live chat can write comments and then Hector anything you'd like to start with and then de yes I mean there are so many things we could discuss because you have brought two very exciting presentations and the first thing I would like to remark is is that there are huge parallelisms between Blake and kard I didn't know the work of kard but now that I learn something I mean there are many many things that they have in common and one other thing I would like to say is for this idea of this recursive self which I'm bringing bringing about one Theory Of Consciousness that of George and norof that Sana and I sort of studying now and he refers to three levels of self to talk of dreams I don't know if I remember correctly just forgive me if I'm not exact but he talks of one interceptive self the other one I think it is exteroceptive correct me if you remember Shana and then he talks of a mental self and the mental self is I would say is when you are absorbed with your thoughts and you you are not aware of the exterior impingements and this happened in dreams dreams the the exterior information is like obliterated so you are producing your sensory information it's your brain it's not responding to external impeachment necessarily and I think that's this idea of this recursivity of the self you can have many layers of self and that's something that Shan and I are now with Michael Walker also trying to see what dreams can inform about the self because this onic self and something that we found exciting is that the s in our dreams recording information so when you are away you remember what you dreamed that's remarkable so this self is living in a PSE world if you will but is still recording information I mean there are many things that are interesting in this self when you are dreaming that you know it's you even when you are not aware that what is happening to you is not real unless you are a lucid dreamer so that for one and I'm going to finish with another thing that I found really enticing of plagues there is a sentence a phrase that is thought to be said by Blake and this is for me it's the Holy Grail of Blakes and I would like to discuss it with you he said um Talent things genius sees and I think this is really interesting it's like his disregarding thought and his vision his thing what is important and I think that connect with this Vision he had throughout his life so he attributes many of his techniques and learnings to Visions in even in dreams most of them come in dreams so what is this difference between thinking and dreaming and I finish with this Leonardo DaVinci was an n he studied reality he studied muscles how he wanted to represent reality as it is I would say he was like a scientist and I think there is the opposite with Blakes I don't think he's interested in reflecting reality as you see it it's what he sees is not reality as we see it it's something else and I I leave it to you now guys because talk a lot this is so exciting thank you Hector Dean well just a second here I'm on you can hear me okay good um yes so my my my sorry Hector this this goes back to what Shana was just uh putting up with the Kirk guard thing and I've I got a kind of a question here I don't know who wants to chime in on this but when you were talking about relationship with self I was thinking about that is that relationship then as self as self organizing in systems and if that's the case sorry pleas please just repeat just repeat the last 10 seconds just self as what okay well relationship with self as a self-organization process right because that we're talking about active inference here so are we then relating with selves we have multiple selves multiple ways of identifying ourself or are we self-relating to the rule not a reduction that we've sent out into the world and then had that fed back to us I'm I'm thinking it purely as an active inference thing which which of course Daniels heard me talk about I I talk about identity as a as a dissemination exercise and I know I we're not talking about necessarily self when we're talking about identity but if we're if we're trying to figure out this business of we we send the sign out and we receive some sort of kind of feedback on that and that forms what who who we think of ourselves as I'm wondering how we take the stuff that kirkgard wrote and and kind of fit I don't want to say I fitted into the active inference frame but at least put the active inference frame underneath it to support it it's a great thought there is active inference in the descriptive mode can be used to say okay kard in a way is describing a cognitive architecture category Theory types of representations can describe the state spaces of the maps that could describe this fantasy world and then it at least gives a comparability to the different proposed cognitive models Hector's way oh okay it was a glitch in time so interestingly it'll be on the stream but now you won't have known so it will have been like a wrinkle in time for you only that's awesome well can we hear what you said yeah oh no okay I just want to say one thing Dean's question is super beautiful and that's why I think the study that very tricky um you know it's sort of like if you put a signal out and nobody understands Who You Are it's like is that you probably have a better relation with your own cells than the thing that's actually feeding back to you which is why I said we have to be careful with that curve if I send it out it comes back as a fractal that's a little messed up and that's why I think Dean's comment is excellent and he what Hector said was absolutely beautiful and correct that and I think Dean what if we could understand the active what if we could slide active inference uh into support the Kira Guardian statement which is highly yita and it investigate it through the anir self what do you think about that when investigating that through the anic setting like Hector and I and and Michael Walker are trying to do would that be one way of looking at of infusing testing the act of inference formalism inside well I'm no expert on dreaming I I kind of just go through and and my way through it but I I mean I'm asking the question because I I thought perhaps Shannon you had some ideas about you know if if we're if we're self organizing and we're in and we're constantly in a relationship and we're trying to bring the idea that um there's a parameterized space and we have to be able to uh do a comparison and stuff I think there actually is an opportunity now to get some some hard evidence and some data and some ways of being able to track this but I'm just not sure where where you would start that's all yeah and that's why I was saying you have these rich structur like starting you know even the profite setting there's a lot of work sort of like that you know space is not this ukian thing to start with and if space is something you know more discretized and that it's you put a topology on it and I get a relation from that and so yeah the question of where do you start I would highly recommend is starting in the profinite world or these the world of these sequences you don't even have a space yet then you build it up through these categorical funs I think that's why I was thinking yita is the place to start and where do you go from that cool what else could we add or where where will we go from here for math art um I have some ideas but I don't know if it's it's talking on my part I'm picking up on what and Dean were discussing I think what Shana said was beautiful and and what she's modeling mathematically is that idea how you chain events and whether they are connected or not and we think that in dreams you don't have a clear line in which you connect things so like when you dream you know it's yourself you even remember what you dreamed so this self in your dreams recording information but then you this self has no age there is no history for this ontic self is not developing a life in parallel with your awake self so we think that this has to do with this subjective timeline of your life you imagine yourself I have a past and a future and you put your memories in this line so this is something that I find interesting how time works in dreams which is what CH says this profin system things are disconnected in dreams there is no a linear thing it's more like random things okay um and the other thing coming back to to D is this idea of the reflective self is like you are and I think Sana mentioned Edgar to did I understood correctly so the that you are of serving yourself you means basically that it's like you're looking at yourself and if you want to relate with active inference one thing that I'm that is intriguing to me is whether you can encapsulate this different self into markco blankets would that make any sense to have Marco blanket for different selves I don't know if that makes sense I'm just thinking it now as as I they go I want to just say one thing to that Dean which is like you know I don't think we don't have to be experts on dream to understand that you know um that something is going on like Hector's idea the brain is storing the differently there's waking State events and then there's onir Shana and Hector had this amazing idea like what if I came on the stream and I was upset with everybody here I was like Daniel you ran around like you hurt Artemis like the cat and then like Hector you did this and Dean I know y'all are all hanging out in Spain you forgot about me I don't know and it's something that we had in the dream state and say we were in a dream and we all went it was like math art and something happened and I remembered it in the waking State and I started being being upset with everybody and it's sort of like oh wait the I should be upset with you for waking state things but now I'm upset with you for dream state things and I don't know the difference my friend was telling me there's an amazing series called like severed or something where the like you get in an elevator and you go to your work or something and like the personal memory is severed from the work memory and vice versa that people would think it would lead to efficiencies but maybe something in the personal life caus you to do something you don't remember and I was thinking it's almost like that sometimes you were severed so the dream the dream uh memory is kept out so that I don't come in my waking State and I start getting upset with people for things that happened in my dream state because I can't tell the difference right Hector pretty much yes yes that's exactly it yeah think that's that's amazing how our brain GS keeps it different Danel yeah to connect it to Blake some of his earlier poetry was about Songs of Innocence and experience and so there's kind of one reading of the developmental within life trajectory of the organism like beginning with innocence or less you know with its priors then continuing on through life experience then there's another reading supported with many many ways with its experienced awareness of Lost Innocence and that is part of a fall myth and metaphor and and symbol not not to reduce it to any one of those but it's like the awareness of having been other after the basian update and then what happens next those are the branching from the moment of experience whereas it's not and not reading isn't the denial of an innocence to experience transfer or direction or something that category the could help understand Dean [Music] yeah I think one of the things that I you know just in my own professional background was being able to hold up both when you put a person of Innocence with a person of experience and you ask the person of Innocence to stretch themselves into an experiential perspective that they don't necessarily possess but they're trying to pick up as quickly as they can you also don't want the person with experience to regress to to some naive but you also want them to be able to view things as though they were it was the first time they encountered it it was kind of like when I would go to the local University and ask them about their uh doctoral thesis defense panels and I said you have at least one person on your panel who knows nothing about the subject of the person who's presenting their thesis I said no no no never and I would ask why not why would wouldn't you have at least one of of three or four people who knows nothing about this so that they could actually be informed that they weren't necessarily critiquing something but they were they were coming at it with that fresh set of eyes and so I think that the the one of the the difficulties is is getting trapped on one side of that innocence uh experienced divide or the other and I don't I'm not going to go back and read Blake again because hopefully he's um told us all that it's it's a matter of being able to unstick yourself and be able to play in both domains at once that's great comments I'll add a little piece there then Hector is there is a lot to say about dualities like the word dialectic was used in the kard section and that's like a diotic dualistic into a third position or resolution or nesting back into one one to two two to one four we can reference again the 4D gives a space enclosure so whereas two like agent a niche it's like it's a diet it's like Well turns out that with a four-fold partition with an inbound and an outbound that foress helps you model API calls from a server and action perception and all these other features two is also there like if you only have two those might be the two to describe or or maybe they're not the two to describe but with only four there starts to be a more of an embodied space enclosure total cognitive systems description scheme that two stretches to fit right all right I'll read a question from the live chat and then any last chats or questions glea maximalist wrote what is Blake's relationship to self how does that play out in his duality of his own private life and his public vision for man I think you want to take that yeah one tension in active inference is expectations and preferences the and prior the three PS from the stream of Dean and Steven man some time ago there's a a not just a a a polysi not just a single function but there's actually like a multiple function for preferences priors and expectations about something and so then it moves into like well to persist as it is but that's firstness that's just inertia so there's a persistence principle so it's like we want the ball at the bottom of the bowl to stay at the bottom of the bowl so there is like an inertial persistence um variance reductive element and then cognitive architectures are built on top of that that propose like secondness and thirdness to expand and not just have something that coasts down to a stop so how to reconcile or just hold this kind of well if you just got that observation again and again I mean why not just go all the way to it and then yet also even that would have to maintain okay how many layers of priors how much nesting and then is that a hyper prior and a hyper hybrid and that's the nested systems within systems and then there's also these biologically flat readings like the poly Computing and Mike Levan all his work where that symbolic nested description of like cells is a valid well typed categorical map but map's not the territory and so just because you can develop stable symbolic systems the system itself may be unstable precariously permanently like life Dean you have you have anything you want to add to that no actually I uh I have to uh go and and make a uh a reservation time here pretty quickly because it's uh it's risoto time here in Portugal so I'm going to uh gracefully step back but uh thank all of you and good to see Hector looking so sharp this even he looks fantastic beautiful he looks abely great for your team thank you guys cool okay any last comments yes I I want to to say again that and relating with what de said and we can wrap up with this I will wrap up with this uh when Blake talks of talent things and genius SE is it Talent sees I mean things experience and genius sees innocence I mean I think I would make that I would interpret like that for him seeing is is more important than knowing or studing and when he portrays Newton when Newton has in front this Darkness at the back of Newton is the colors The Reef the AL guy all the colors are at his back and his intent in throwing um kind of rigid structures or a mechanistic world and I don't know if you think that that might be the message that seeing is goes beyond thinking and I finish with that that's an incredible reading like Newton face down studying for geometry sketching out the lines back turned and and closed off from the natural world yes and and that re the recognition that the sketch pad isn't the natural world to lose either capacity would be a reduction is that an Adaptive reduction that's just the niche to say so the adaptivity and then that's a lot of where Blake and nche start to get explored together with like okay with the persistence then as an imperative how does that revision moral normativities that's interesting reading yeah I think so I think newon is thinking for Blake is not seeing that's what I what I feel that if he was looking the other way he would be seeing so what needs to be seen is at his back and he's intending something that is not so worthy perhaps I don't know I mean that's going too far maybe I like it and I I I just want to say you know so what we're going to be exploring next is um when I bring in my great colleague about this phenomenology of like six spirit and these constructions of you know you can construct various theories of like you know Madness and Things based on exactly what we're talking about to what extent right is uh is this Infiniti of the reflections of the self this balance this sharing of Hardware between sensory apparatus and the imagination right so what is there what I think is there infinite reflections of what could be there and so these uh these perfect future like I will have done this things like that I think are very very um beautiful and to examine them from the perspective of phenomena technology of something like sick or you know like ill Spirit like what does that mean so coming up a lot to explore then too so thank you to Dean Hector and Shanna all right thanks guys and bye for
