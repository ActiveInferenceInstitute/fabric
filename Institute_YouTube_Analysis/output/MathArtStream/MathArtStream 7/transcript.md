all right hello and welcome this is math Arts stream 7 August 16th 2024 it will be a great and interesting stream I hope so shanana to you to begin hi Daniel thank you for having us welcome everybody thanks for joining us so today we're going to do part two of our Harry Potter series on dementor animagus and episodic memory so literally an active in inference exploration of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of aaban all right it's going to be a ride so in our last mathart stream number six we excitedly introduced the Harry Potter series and we talked about Dementors which were these wraithlike creatures that were on the dark side of the world and they were a mortal which is actually really exciting um and Estelle has something to show us from her interpretation of what a dmentor is yes uh hello everybody so um yeah so for my version of the dementor I was thinking of the dementor as being um some sort of a doo ganger um so like would look like a ghostly double of a living person right um and here it would exist as a Quantum entity um and uh it would be entangled with the original person's emotional and mental States and so through this entanglement um the Doper ganger uh can influence the quantum States associated with happiness and probably uh and like eventually drawing energy from these states and so the way it would work is that um this creature would detect and establish quantum entanglement with the brain regions that are associated with happy memories and um it would use quantum uh tunneling to penetrate those regions um without physical interaction without touching the subject and um through those um either Quantum measurement or decoherence those uh Quantum States would collapse and um because of the collapse the memories would get either like erased or alterated and this way happy memories could be just um yeah halfway through um uh deleted and uh we would only have the bad side of those memories this is how uh would work in this uh situation and for the way I represented it is that um even though the dopang ganger is one entity like one clone one double um I represented it as being um multiplied because uh because it's more about how you feel when you have this phenomenon happening to you um and in this case it's like very overwhelming and um it's like it's kind of everywhere around you around this region around your head and so that's why like there's like three of them uh you know um yeah around around him um but there really one one doping hanger um yes so this is this is what I have for this this deer Vision um yeah wow and I love it so much I love it so much and especially when Estelle is focusing on like what does it feel like we're really going to try to tap into that CU and um Harry Potter when you actually see the animagus transformation happening you don't really see like what it feels like or anything like that so okay so today everyone we're going to talk about animagus so again if you're unaware of what this is beautiful beautiful concept construct in JK Rings prisoner baban so an animagus is a wizard or witch that can literally transform themselves into an animal and back to their original form at will so the key there is that well a they can go one way but they can also come back and it's at will this can be learned so Animas takes into account literally the phenomena of shape shifting so this is one of the oldest forms of totemism and Shamanism and so um Hector would you like to tell us a little bit about this slide about the origins of shape shifting well I mean the origins are are these creatur are present in many cultures and for instance navajos and they use their word Forin and normally is the medicine man who can adopt the shape of another animal and and then we have like in in Greek mythology we have S and this going after leader in the in these guys like um swam this is has been represented in in many paintings in Renaissance and then we have vampires which is part of the culture also they transform into bats so there are many cultures have it also the Epic of Gilgamesh also has this idea of shape shifting so it's quite it's interesting because there is this is present in many cultures and I think what is important is that this is not a werewolf this is someone that gets transform into an animal but keeps its Consciousness more or less prec so would be different to a werewolf that loses himself or herself into the wild wolf yeah and so Hector brings up a really interesting point there so because we're doing math art fronts we're going to really try to dig into the active inference side of the animagus creature versus the werewolf so like Hector was saying so the animagus Wizards um the so they can actually learn to change their shape to adopt this form of an animal a dog or cat or rat as seen in the the the series and even with this new body they retain their human identity like Hector was saying so somehow they can retain and retrieve their episodic and semantic memories like Hector talked about in our last two streams and the conscious awareness Associated them being a human so there's this continuity of their human self as it were and so when they adopt the body of this cat dog or rat they don't seem to change to a conscious experience of of being a dog or cat or rat so Hector can you tell us a little bit about like Nagel's work with this what is it like to be a bat and how qualia come into play here yeah yeah well I mean I'm not the the I'm not an expert in philosophy but with this idea of Nagel I mean probably you know about it also and he had this this paper it's a classical paper already about what would we like to be about and with that he means that we cannot reduce the experience is very similar to the hard problem of Consciousness when you can imagine yourself like having this echol localization this different way of perceiving the world but you can imagine it with your own senses with your own ideas with your own mind but you will never be able to feel it like a BT to that you would need to be a b so you would you can try to think how would experience the world but you haven't never experienced that through their senses through the senses of abat so it's it's well now impossible that you can feel like a b and I think that's interesting because um if you transform in another animal how would you perceive the world how you feel what would be the quality of your experiences and I think that's interesting in terms of this old philosophical debate I mean for some people there is no Pro they they don't see this a problem like this qual a problem of the heart problem of Consciousness there this the community is divided between is there a problem with that or is there not a problem so there are more reductionist views um but I think it's interesting to reflect on on this I think it is too it's going to come up in just a little bit like sort of um uh do you have both is it a costume so um I'll wrap up the slid so um so what's going on the animagus is very unlike what happens with werewolves like Hector was saying that become wild and actually forget their human nature when they transform so this is like Ramos Lupin contrast with Sirius Black for instance so therefore we're saying that either animagus they do not necessarily form episodic memories or personal memory while under their animal shape so either sirious black does not have episodic memories when he's a dog um or if they do they store their experiences in association with their habitual human episodic Recollections so this is interesting so this opens up really intriguing questions in relation to active inference so uh like we were saying as for the general World models themselves so these are actually built from experience from sensory experience and they're used to detect the regularities and make predictions in order to reduce the prise so I am a wolf I have a very powerful jaw I want to bite versus Shana I'm the wizard mathematician and so I have um different um generative World models based on like what I am in the moment and then um Hector do you want to say a little bit about the active inference how we use that to probe yes uh and perhaps Daniel can help me with this because acting inference is very much about acting and sensing the world um the way you sense the world is different when you are a human for instance visual cues are predominant and when you are a WF probably smells so you you you introduce information in your generative models through different sensory and different senses and I'm wondering how would that work actually so I don't know if you Daniel have any idea I mean do they have different generative models a set for when you are a human and then a set of generative model for when you are a war I just I don't know I mean that's kind of yeah let's return to it okay good H this is the fun part so what actually happens in the animagus we're sort of poking a hole here do they have different sets of world models for when they occupy their human habitual body and for when they occupy the alternative animal body so if so then the sensory gathered information will follow different paths when they're in the human body and when they're in the alternative animal shape moreover the memories that they form will have to be kept separate too otherwise their human and non-human animal cells would eventually get mixed up is it even potentially possible this is sort of like the movie wolf with like James Spader Michelle feifer and James Spader's like oh I love that cologne have on and she's like get away from me because he's turning into this wolf you know and Jack Nicholson's just always cool okay so the question is like are anim Magus like a costume do you like if Shana becomes wolf do I jump into like a wolf uh machine I'm kind of playing around what's the difference and so stelle has something beautiful to show us about her interpretation of anim magots yeah so um so my version uh um I have am a character um uh that would fit in the Harry Potter series and so um she she would be called like bester G horn and she's a wolf animagus um and so I included steps of transformation to explain how it could work um more maybe more realistically and so but it's you know it's really just one version um so uh what I did is um for at the beginning um she would um her body would like start sweating and she would start SE creating a certain kind of uh fluid uh and this uh fluid would be like specific material who would become sticky and uh more solid over time and so um because it's not a very agreeable experience it's actually a little yeah it's a little uncomfortable so she has to she has to crouch and um and she actually um ends up on the floor and um in a like a FAL position and um the those this fluid will start like um moving and uh enveloping her and um become solid and create this kind of uh this sort of cocoon um which is really a way to create um some sort of artificial womb um where the transformation would would take place and so um all of this would take place inside and um and in the end on this once the transformation is done um um she would come out in her new form and uh here it's like she's turning from Human to Wolf but it can also go back it's can also happen when uh she's a wolf and then she goes back to being a human um and uh and yeah I was thinking of that of this way of transforming because um I was thinking of just us as human beings we we when we are taking shape inside the womb of our mother um this is how it happens and I wanted to emphasize that because um this is more this is not a costume it's more like you become something else you become but your yeah your Consciousness is still there um but you you turn into something else that's real and it's not just a a spell that changes your appearance right um and so uh I created like little a mini chart with some characteristics um that she has as a human and then how it shows when she's a wolf um and uh I also wanted to emphasize that uh in this transformation nothing is lost nothing is created everything is just transformed so everything transfers um and that's like very very important and because of that we have some characteristics like aggressiveness territoriality that are almost not existent when she's but there it's there but like very very um it's very not not not intense at all when she's human and then when she turns into a wolf it it really it really is more like way stronger um and then uh on the on the other hand when she's human she's very creative but once she turns into a wolf this creativity just like drops um and uh and all of her characteristics kind of transfer and some of them stay the same um because they're just I'd say core characteristics that won't change um and uh yes so this is my this is my version of the Magus um yeah this is this is what I have what do you guys think yeah Hector do you want to say anything before I think it's amazing I mean just the technique I mean the drawings are wonderful and also very original the name it could go very well with Harry Potter series this vper Gilder horn or G of Thrones I mean it would be any in any epic fantasy book and I like it very much and also the details of the transformation and this abilities that change I mean that's very very interesting I mean you you really have work on this character I mean I mean congratulation I mean I love it I love it too and I really I love the chart that Estelle saying when Hector and I were thinking about is a is an Animas kind of of a hybrid like if Shana's going to turn into wolf like my spunkiness just becomes a little more like raw you know like is it just you take the sort of characteristics that you have and anim Magus as Force multiplier and then my mathematical creativity just turns into like I just really want to bite everything yeah exactly that's why I love that chart right it's like oh my mathematical creativity is now a little Primal yeah I love it especially the ey I mean the eye she has I mean it's just like I think it's so beautiful and I was telling that the eyes in The Wheel of Time which is one book also I like uh perin which is this character that gets into a wolf like when he dreams he has this golden eyes and is I mean at some point the eyes change color into golden and then he starts to dream of wolves and go with a pack of wolves so this is kind of also a typical detail of w white this Golden ice thing that's interesting I love it um okay beautiful thank you so much Estelle I'll be coming back and forth to this so what Estelle is showing here with Vesper is really showing that you know the anamatic it's not just a costume that sort of slide into that that's an actual some kind of metamorphosis which is um very difficult to point down so we have this question just to make sure everyone um can sort of stay with us when this gets a little complic ated is that is is what's going on with veser Vesper here or just the animagus creature can this be equated to what happens in a butterfly um when it's actually you know leaving the crystal estasion turning um I'm sorry in a caterpillar when it leaves the crystallis stage and turns into a butterfly so the caterer larel state has this what's called um complete metamorphosis so it goes into this Crysis form which is like this cocoon and then from that it can become like a both a moth or a butterfly so this is actually uh pretty wild what's happening in this phase so Daniel's the genius but Daniel's also an ant genius and has studied like insectoid so we're going to talk a little bit more about that but the freaky thing about animagus is that it also goes back right so it's not just from caterpillar to butterfly but it's also it can go back and that's the thing that seems a little tricky so with the going back um I really want to poke this what does it feel like so I have said endlessly that to be able to feel when this butterfly is undergoing this um just to be able to feel and to feel deeply I think is a real gift so yeah we have like this ability to rationalize but I've also just been always so enchanted by the ability to feel anything um especially as creatives in this room like I think it's a very a very beautiful thing so I just want to poke a little bit I know it's contentious to sort of ask like well which creatures have something like an emotional relationship with their pain I don't know if this is a very pleasant experience to undergo something like this um on the floor kind of hurting which is why I said pain I'm just starting with pain um so you know I'm actually interested in this question for which creatures does there exist this because I have been diagnosed with x i therefore feel why seems to be that this is a l level of metacognition I'm going to poke Hector about this in a second but if you without it if you did not have this emotional relationship with your pain then you would just accept the pain the new diagnosis whatever it is as what it is there's no guilt there's no penitence there's no regret um we don't seem to sort of do that and so uh maybe I'm poking a little bit deeper than what's going on in animagus I don't really see regret when serus black turns into a dog it almost seems like a gift I can do this to change form go get some information and come back so if this is a level of metacognition for a creature to actually have an emotional relationship with the pain then that's going a little bit deeper and it's going to pull into something that's called autonoetic Consciousness which Hector's going to talk about we've both been Enchanted by this like for a bit um and so we can just have like a rough idea of this so literally autonomic Consciousness ability to mentally travel to the past future counterfactual sit situations and examine one's own thoughts so Hector did you want to say anything just a little bit about more or I say that enough is that pretty much what it is well I think there are too many things to commment on oh yeah just like a couple if not no re for one thing the emotional relationship with their pain is a tricky because you've got the basic emotions that humans are like in born with them like fear so this is something that babies already exhibit from the from the beginning and then we have what they call the Social emotions or secondary emotions that appear later dat in in development I mean maybe two years which is when you see yourself from the point of view of the other like you feel guil or regret if you are able to some kind of perspective taking you need to see yourself from the other perspective so this is quite complex so I think that um the basic emotions could be more widespread but this social secondary more complex emotions that require that you take the perspective of others that are more complex so will be more difficult to find and then as for automatic Consciousness just a reminder or refreshing what we talk about the other session is related to the time travel ability so it's like projecting yourself to the Future and to the past and being aware that you were there experiencing those things th those episodic Recollections so again this is very complex and requires a lot of executive control to throw this self to a very specific um um point in time so again this would be quite complex I agree with Hector that seems a very complicated process and to be able to examine one's own thoughts so like which creatures actually experience autonoetic Consciousness I think it's a very difficult question so something like I came up with this idea like the regret of the butterfly the butterfly says oh me I remember being a caterpillar inching along that tree plump and Squishy I was so free why I have these wings now what they did to me let me SOB like I would be upset does the butterfly have autonoetic Consciousness I remember when I was a caterpillar and so like in terms of active inference like what is the cost of regret of feelings of metacognitive transport I remember being plump and Squishy and now I have wings this is very tricky so I have this funny question like if all creatures could regret what would this place look like right Daniel all the ants are sad they're like I'm just never GNA get anywhere you and so when you have these emotions I think emotions are really amazing but question is where do they come from so how would this actually work in the animagus if human and animal memory are actually retained and jointly acting so to bring in like this hard problem of Consciousness what and how does the animaga see what do they feel um I you know I don't I don't see um I mean maybe from you know if Ramos Lupin completely loses awareness that he's turning into a werewolf there may not be regret on the other side he may see some bite marks it may be um completely strange Estelle was telling me about a show called like severed right so yeah where that's kind of like sort of partitioning work memory and like personal memory and this is a very strange thing to actually have happening that maybe some things are happening in your work life you don't remember in your personal life and yeah very very very original idea so animagus and Fantasia are hyper fantasic more anim Magus like what happens um do you uh do you have a more propensity to feel more because you are on the hyper Fantasia scale so you can have you know like the regretful butterfly the penitent squirrel the hyper fantasic Swan like what's going on here why is it only for certain mammal creatures so I'm really pushing the question of which creatures experience episodic memory and why and so like Hector was saying this is really pulling in subjective experience and Paulie and Thomas Nagel um Hector anything on this slide or should I just keep going feels good well I can command um first of all I mean I like your poetry looks like the world with man oh butterfly lament ofly interesting piece and and then what I would say of [Music] um of this memory um episodic memory it's quite complex again for instance if we talk of a neuron atomy it involves hippocampus to to to get this context to put together the where and when and how and then it also involves prefrontal cortex and paroc region at least in humans that we know by neurological studies so I don't know how d looks like in in insects I mean in in Birds I know they have like this let me think if I remember is the nalum uh nalum something I think it's I don't remember the other part of the name but it's a structure that is similar to prefrontal Cortex but I have no clue if insects have something of the sort so I don't know if you Daniel know in NS or other insects if they have something similar but I have no notion yeah I remember name now in bird is Nali so this is they say was like a prefrontal corter structure it's similar to but I don't know if there is something in insects also like that I mean I have no notion at all so no idea I think that's really we're talking a very complex skills that have lots of metacognition involved I would say a lot of right and we don't know I mean the butterfly that I see outside my window right now very much be regretting as she's flopping around like I don't know okay um I'll pass over this okay so to uh to go just a little bit um um deeper into the butterfly we just want to recap a couple processes that Hector went over last time in our stream six morphogenesis this is the process by which a a system actually acquires a shape self-confirmation is about very complicated process of self-identity and um using a generative model to sort of retain my self identity I don't have wings I don't have wings maybe strange if I did have wings things like that um and autop poesis which is the capacity of a system to create its own parts and maintain itself so these likewise are very complicated um things but you could probably have autop poesis without episodic memory so if we go back to um so to poke the butterfly just a little bit further so to look at this deeper in active inference which of course really complicated while it was a worm the generative models would be tuned to being a worm I'm squishy I'm inching this is this is how I look OTE the predictions would be fit to be fals or confirmed by probing with specific senses those of a worm so surprise would also be tune to being a worm and so then to talk about autop poesis the worm selfcon information is related to it being terrestrial or Boreal it will try to confirm that it is not flying at all costs however once it is a butterfly it will have to change the confirmatory imperatives to find itself flying that is an interesting change so while being floating in the air should cause a great deal of surprisal while being a worm but now it will cause no surprisal at all while under the butterfly form um Hector you want to say anything about like how surprising the surprise and surprisal is of something like this well that's tricky yeah I mean that's just speculating about how it would go because if you're a fish you want to confirm at the cost that you're embedded in water because your survival depends on that so surprise comes when you don't feel you are embedded in water but now we have an insect that change all of a sudden so how is this self-confirmation conducted and that's that's kind of an a thought problem I don't know how this would go but it's an interesting question I think for active inference I do too and I hope it's something that we can explore deeply because I think there's some really rich stuff there and and just waiting for New Concepts and new constructs to be formed inside of that uh what's surprising in this case and the worm has wings but the worm has to adapt to it hence that's why I asked that question earlier is there an tional relationship with change and just another thing I wanted to add that just came off the to of my head now uh also what happens with the information you have acquired I mean you are building these generative models you're accumulating LW and information you are updating them you are making more predictive now you change you are a different um a different shape I mean or different don't think you can say a different insect but maybe you can warm a butterfly what happened with all that information you stored as a worm is this passed on to the butterfly only part of it are passed on so that's I think that's also interesting to think about it I mean maybe some people have investigated this but I think it's an interesting question yeah I think that's a really interesting question um so literally what Hector is asking is you know just I think very very difficult and very exciting and intriguing what and where is the memory during a complete metamorphosis so if we're talking about genetic memory or episodic if we have episodic there question is um is the morphogenesis the actual complete metamorphic process I was thinking that if this was so absolute that the caterpillar in the crysalis stage has no memory left and the transformation is merely genetic something like this is what Hector is saying how much what and how much is actually transferred over moreover where is the experience of transforming stored is it in the middle in the impass between caterpillar crystallis to butterfly like where is it and I think that's actually really tricky um again not sure if someone's investigated that but it would be super fun to look at that because I'm on the pain side I'm like what too painful is it too surprising using Hector like zones of bounded surprisal which I think is a beautiful concept like um is it too surprising to be fully aware of that complete transformation process we know that the dragonfly is like a super Predator has a very very high accuracy rate um and so I know like you know when all of its energy and goes into the sort of visual a system does it actually have a big memory system doesn't have episodic memories and so what's sort of the cost of doing something like that what is the energetic cost of episodic memory but I think this is like what Hector and I are poking at is like where is the experience of transforming story right Hector in the middle this is sort of what you were talking about right yeah yes but I would I would like to say that um I don't think I would expect the episod in memory in the butterfly because it's as to Define it we cannot even prove that in in nonhuman AIDS because you need this autonoetic awareness and this is something you can only report verbally so um there is no way to prove a nonverbal species have this self-consciousness this consciousness of or disability to time travel mentally and also because there are so many structors involved like prefrontal cortex hoc campus it would be I don't know it would be difficult to ECT this in an insect or at least I mean I don't want to be taxa but I wouldn't dare to hint that they have episodic memories another thing is that they retain information that for sure because probably what they have learned it's it's likely that they retain some information that is vital for their survival as a butterfly so the question for me would be more interesting to think what of the information they acquired as warm is retained and used as a butterfly is there any useful information is retained or do they have some kind of ingrain genetical information that they just is triggered by the environment when they are a warm or a butterfly so I think this would be a more pertinent question because talking of memory is very tricky and then 12 of epis memory in this case excellent okay yeah so can you just say that um one more time for us so the way to be thinking about this I like this is that is there any information yeah terms of information which information is salvaged like from the worm and is preserved and used by the butterfly that I think it would be a very interesting question yeah I think that's like that's very interesting on the information side right so you can ask these questions like you know what can on the information side like Hector is saying um this is Flowing very beautifully day I like that what controls metamorphosis right and what information is responsible for metamorphosis so you can have these key evolutionary stages you know from protocells multicellular life to animals fish and tetrapods mammals to great apes homosapiens and at the same time you can chart probably autonoetic or the structures that are actually built to form autonoetic Consciousness and just watch the information in storage I think that storage of information probably takes some more comp licated shape as we increase along the evolutionary stage and you know so um various levels of metamorphosis from genetic memory to personal memory and um you can see the baby um like turning into just evolving so from um like traces and nontransferred what affects the genetic memory um to like from environmental factors and epigenetics to um sensory triggers and this is like what Hector and I are talking about what what in the the crystallis stage is actually transferred over into the butterfly if I poke the caterpillar or you know not heard it but like mess with the you know the crystallis a little bit is that going to transfer over and the butterfly has some kind of sensory memory of like what's actually going on what controls metamorphosis I think is like a little more um tricky about you have an active trigger and what what actually um triggers the metamorphosis process and so that the question that is very cool for the animagus Wizards and like veser Witch is like what controls in and out of that morph so I want to um just sort of ask open up the floor a little bit for some cool questions and then have Daniel um talk about steppen wolf which is Herman hess's beautiful um recollection of of this sort of animaga state so if anybody's any thoughts um I just have a couple cool active inference questions um I know I have a mathematization of this but just anybody have any thoughts on like how since internal and action States um or Daniel yeah would actually change during morphogenesis just something to help anybody I would like to say something before you you go with the just the this image of the species like this evolutionary lava um this is not very accurate in terms of there is no lather of ascending complexity or Evolution and being humans is more like a tree so it's about adaptation to the environment and there is no this linearity so I think we we need I mean Daniel I think he will agree with us because we study uh he animal from a comparative perspective so I think we would like to take that this is kind of a representation that appears in many places but we don't intend to imply that there is some kind of evolutionary laa where we are at the top of the L because that would be totally false and Incorrect and now we can carry with this yeah and as well it is or one could make it not saying that visualization has accuracy of of what kind but like you could do evolutionary state reconstructions for a path so it's like for the person in that car it was like the N equals 1 trace or for that population and yet viewed it's also of course just the shrub and all these horizontal Gene transfer all these things um this is a great question um an active inference about this memory Uh I that came up several times is where and how would information be retained as episodic accessible rather than just learning or influence because you could have a parameter updating through time like Colman filter but that then discards the data so it doesn't have episodic recollection or it may it doesn't have it doesn't have the ability to say well where was the cman filter this many time steps ago or the the logging of the common filter parameter through time could be encoded and accessible and I think also with with generative AI what is what is a real episodic memory because it's not like the situation is being retained in a neural system it's some compression or representation or unpacking it can be very sophisticated but at some point it is all mixed up with the systems other cognitive phenotypes so it's not like it's a CD in an archive that gets dusted off so what is what is the gradient of the real generative fabricated memories when even the ones that count as like the gold standard episodic memory have a highly generative proc Ed element to them if if you get into specific details especially so then is it just a recollection of a narrative compression but then is that real but then if you actually experienced a memory and remembered it then that's as real as what that's as real as what I love that to kind of um take what Daniel's saying I think I was thinking that you could sort of mathematize this metamorphosis as some sort of um functor storage so an interesting way to think about this categorically is that there's a powerful object called a forgetful funter that is a map between categories and it can forget certain structures in the input so which is called like colloquially like the forget um forgetting the structure morphism and forgetful is just an informal word it's more like an ad joint so an example something like you have a funter u from the category of groups to the category of sets where U of G is actually the under set of G its set of elements and if F from G to H is a group homomorphism then U of f is actually the function f itself so you would say that U is forgetful in the sense that you forgets the group structure of groups forgets that group homomorphisms are homomorphisms so um you could say that a sort of metamorphosis is in a sense some sort of forgetful so you can forget the structure of a to turn into something else so there's also a forgetful funter from the category of rings to the category of ailing groups that actually forgets a multiplicative structure remember it's just the underlying additive groups so this sort of skimming but you know making a categorical butterfly and the question is how do you go back so beautifully in category theory if if a forgetful funter is um often representable and if it's a right ad joint then you have something called a a free functor which is a left ad joint it can put the structure back in so like I said when we kind of ran into a problem from Caterpillar to Crystalis to Butterfly well categorical butterfly would have a a left ad joint and can go back which I think is fun a couple more questions just Lightly for Daniel and then I want to hear steepen wolf totally so if you find these kind of boring just tell me to keep going um so how or where um is the information for morphogenesis stored in the case of terminal development or cyclic morphological changes seasonal you were telling about um the uh was it the squirrel or the mouse that changes its coat for the winter Daniel yesterday forgot something yeah great question Estella or Hector go for it Hector anything yes I think that's a very interesting question and there is something that picking up on what Daniel said before that was very interesting um perhaps you don't rain the episodes I mean you lack the context for instance the other the other live stream we talk of this process that was going semantization of episodic memory that means that as the time goes by episodic memories become semantic memories which is another type of declarative memory where you lack the context so you only retain the basic information so that would be one possibility that these episodes you live before in your previous shape become semantic memory so you don't have the context and you don't remember you don't need to project yourself to the Past you just retain the information that is useful and that's an interesting possibility and and and also you you touch on something interesting when you talk of these funs to forget because memory does not necessarily come as a failure maybe it's good for you that you forget some things that you don't need any anymore so that's an interesting idea this fun that makes you forget things that you don't need anymore so would be interesting that the butterfly forgets what it doesn't need anymore and just can get in the way that's pure speculation on my part but I think it would be useful theoretically yeah not lost just forgotten correct not needed let's forget what we don't need um so the really powerful questions and I'll let Daniel talk about this like in Stephen wolf what is going to trigger this character in and out of this morph you know so for me I'm thinking on the physics side the gner point is this Fantastical Point um that's often mentioned in string theory where a shape can actually pass through this point and undergo a topology change that is not a friendly change so like sudden genus change if all genus one objects turned into Genus 2 objects like that would be intense I'm eating like Cheerios for breakfast genus one and it turns into like Genus 2 like what would that would be wild but what we're poking at here is sort of like like what Hector is saying like is continuity over a Time gotten by a forgetful funter you have to forget things to interpolate and actually have this can you have a butterfly as a three category of course I'm GNA talk about this I just want to say a couple things like another interesting question of probe would be like what is the metacognitive status of the animal form which is like what we were saying are its false positive negative rates or episodic semantic memories from their human form what would that say about the neural substrate of memory also a fun question is like what are different ways to make you know active inference models of animagus phenomena like if we had one in a zoo or at the aquarium that I'm going to in two days or at the montere aquarium you know we should have like that'd be so cool to have one in a zoo and like uh Daniel Super Genius that like the insect life history so this um is really going to connect to like the Hol metabolic the Hemi metabolic and how these trajectories actually cover parts of the developmental State spaces so in our remaining time I just want to have Daniel tell us a little bit about can you tell us a little bit about this um the powerful novel stepen wolf and what's going on there because I think that's very very exciting and passionate cool I'm GNA give two quick William Blake related notes since I think they're really pertinent and then going into the Steen wolf so first this is a a four-line poem called eternity from Blake he who binds to himself a joy does the wing life destroy he who kisses the joy as it flies lives in eternity Sunrise so that's very interesting about the butterfly winged life being in eternity Sunrise kind of with a lot of themes about time and timelessness then another one not not read cuz it's a longer it's called the mental traveler and it's very cool and it has animals and it deals with mental travel which is kind of a topic that comes up like in the navigation in arbitrary State spaces kind of work okay here's a few little steepen wolf so I don't want to go into the plot at all because I'm sure it's available so I'll try to give them minimal details this is a novel written by Herman Hess Hessa in 1927 and there's a main character named Harry holler so a funny hairy crossover and he's a middle-aged person okay now the reason why Steen wolf comes into this animagus anamorph morphology discussion and what I think makes it a fun complement to what we've been discussing uh what if the morphological changes that we're describing were taken as symbolic so morphological change is what happens to that kind of n equals one body like the person's actual physical embodiment going into the Cocoon being part of the Cocoon then having and then all the questions arising there um the interesting thing about Steen wolf and the primary kind of plot fulcrum is that Hower has a dual human wolf cognitive experience so it isn't that he turns into a four-legged crawling I mean a dog walking style it doesn't it's not a canis situation it's a it's a dual SL multi cognitive situation and so that's really interesting I think also in Connected really with Estelle's first piece with the dementor there was one person and then there was multiple of these alternative like Quantum States or ghosts or or whatever these alternative things were and then um in terms of the plot it is again mainly centering around his dual wolf human dialectic however there are a lot of pointers that the wolf is just kind of like the primary or the summary kind of like the igen dementor because there's more facets but the book focuses on the one onone and the one plus one with the human and the Wolf awareness and and I think again that really also ties back to Memories what how what would the memory be on the metamorphosis as interface what's the kind of Markoff blanket of metamorphosis that's a forgetting and a transformation component and then what's the unpacking like there's just a lot of questions and what form and format are all those kinds of learnings and and changes reflected with how is that related to the environment which could be a stationary environment or it could be a discontinuous environment change to too like if that's seasonally triggered so many kinds of life forms plants animals Etc that they change with Seasons if not with days or other kind of relevant time scales so that was on steppen Wolf yeah D I have a question on that and then Hector please jump in um so when you're saying it's sort of a cognitive struggle can you give us an example of that Daniel maybe for people who haven't um who haven't read this I think it's very rich one way to look at it is in terms of archetypes or competing Tendencies or competing identifications or duel and the relationship between Duality or multiplicity like I was the person who just had the cup here but then I was previously the person who had it here and I'm the person who wants it here and so what are how there's some single track stream of Consciousness um type awareness and then there's kind of uh that's more explicit that's what was an interesting discussion about the regret like in evaluation upon and then it's like well are there situations where it's adaptive or or different or just in different ways to have a sort of well that's how it was so why would there be a continued free energy different ential with like I can't believe this happened but then it did so how do all those kinds of of continuous and re-evaluation of memories because there is a situation where like you learn something at a time step and it's like that's why that was happening then those are real situations so it can't be stored in a way that doesn't enable those Transformations but again what is being stored anyway as you brought up Hector do you want to say anything well I would only pick up on this idea of Duality because if you think a wolf I mean in in in our culture we use the term wolf sometimes to refer to someone who is solitary but wolf are very social and they depend on each other to survive so this is a duality in itself and I think it happened with us also because we have very social but you you you also need to struggle for your own freedom and and I'm just thinking in anthropology when you have these smallcap societies you have a very rigid roles depending on age and sex so there is little Freedom there because you have a high dependency of the group so you don't want to be ostracized and I guess in big cities we have more freedom to explore different selves and and I think I like that idea of Duality you always have this struggle between what Society expects from you and what you want for yourself and and this can be that's a very rich theme yeah and to give a sort of recent evolutionary perspective the domestication and the self-domestication sort of plur domestication processes with a dog to Wolf continuum that continues and has recency and all these fractals whereas if it was about a person who was having an experience related to their social humanness and all of his thinking about class and about other people's thoughts the human and the cultured and the civilizational and that kind of perspective with a nematode it gives the story a different flavor oh that's like the kofka metamorphosis or that's more like my friend dragon or whatever there's another or it could be a creature we do have or it could be a creature that used to exist on Earth but then doesn't now so it's like it that's what the animal symbolism invokes and so that's that's a whole space with all the animals wow okay always leave us um always leave us wanting more more I can't recommend this novel enough it is intense right Daniel it's a lot um um but for what you can get out of it I think it's really really nice on the level of um Copus metamorphosis of course so I think it's almost 11 so I will say just thanks everyone for joining us we're going to have a um a really cool upcoming Stream So mathart stream 8 I think I think we're about ready for Daniel's uh like William Blake Deep dive the poem that you read today the title of the poem you read today was called what eternity eternity okay I will leave everybody with eternity and then also some forthcoming mathart streams so I I have some forthcoming fiction novels you know I'm always trying to mathematize stuff Daniel I'm not sure if you've ever read Phantom toll booth or anything like that okay amazing work I was trying to show us still that it's like a St we can make some amazing things so I'm doing this like mathematical version of phantom toll booth which everyone can imagine what that's like and like a categorical Narnia so I really want to take this idea and um have something on like what I'm calling the hyper fantasic Swan and digitopolis so a sort of fantasic phantom toll booth because I think um episodic memory is definitely at play when you actually have a digitopolis and dictionopolis sort of um fighting there with the word space and Milo anyway it's incredible work um also I was contacted um by incredible person about streaming um on the Delian side and so we want to do something about Biometrics noise and delo for Halloween so a kind of like fun um Halloween stream I think Halloween is actually on the um the Thursday which is the 31st and so the Friday is the first but if the Friday Friday is kind of the the mirror of the 31st then you flip it and it'll be Friday the 13th so we're hoping that like November 1 is like Friday the 13th in the mirror side and we have a Halloween stream then so awesome I'll say thank you thank you Estelle thank you Daniel thank you Hector is my pleasure and I had so much fun thank you yeah thank you till next time e
