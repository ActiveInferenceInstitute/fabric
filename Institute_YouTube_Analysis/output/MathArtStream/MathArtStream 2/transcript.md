all right hello and welcome it is May 24th 2024 we're in math art stream two Dean take it away thanks Daniel um my name is Dean tickles I'm here in Calgary Canada and I'm presenting today with uh my friend and colleague uh Stephen s it hello welcome everyone pleasure to be here I'm in Toronto and uh we look forward to sharing some of the tracable insights um that we hope can be shed on complex interactions and Dynamics which will be illuminated more by Dean in the world of math art I'll pass it back to you Dean thanks so we want to straight up we give people a chance to sort of look at the general outline today what what we're doing is we're trying to honor our pioneering predecessors from last week with uh the great uh Foundation that Daniel and and shanana and and Hector they down we want to want to honor that we also want to thank them for the preparations and the enthusiasm it makes it a lot easier because there's a lot of inertia already generated today's agenda has has two components to it the first is to make clear the different potential strategies that one can use when math art becomes the vehicle on which to venture out and make new discoveries the exploring exploit of an open range so not sort of things that are closed in and fenced in The Knowing of which strategy is being used when you find yourself in those kind of context depends on how one sets their perspective from priors the second agenda item is to determine how we might look at math art in different ways other than what we might choose as a default now we heard last week a lot of this is what I think of when I think math art so I kind of focused on the thinking part this is in order to create new potential new tractability and new insights new I do of math art as opposed to I thinks we believe we'll be able or have arrived if today's presentation raises more questions than it generates answers if you find yourself dis agreeing that will take as a feature and a potential to catch ourselves using reflection and transaction frames which are pretty common in education or something that we're going to try to introduce today an expansion interaction quote being part of the morphism frame if you haven't had a chance give you quick look at the outline Stephen you had a comment about making sure that we didn't uh get caught up in things like non-dualism pluralism and flat ontologies do you want to just quickly comment on that yeah I think that one of the challenges is that we have particular ways that people might have a high level ontology of how they describe terms and they have their own fields of practice Etc so um at some point um we're going to make it clear and clearer that having the idea of unifying principles which the free energy principle is is very useful for and holding a number of possibilities rather than having the correct definitions which in all honesty are changing a lot all the time especially in the art world that's where we're coming from so that's one of the things um can I just make one other point which is just that on the six degrees also there is some activities around uh the power of six which um are really powerful for Illuminating networks of information we're not going to go into that now but it sort of ties into how some of the things here show potentials for other ways of engaging with processes that are half art of math so just really quickly we're gonna I'm GNA try to keep a stopwatch on this because it's really really easy to go down rabbit holes and and break your leg and not every be able to get back after all we are today looking at the concept of opening up and optioning up so no loading up our plates with only bacon rashers the uh there's a smorgasport of potential awaiting uh so Daniel can you go to the next slide so here's our six themes today we're going to pick up the Baton we're going to uh let's see here yeah we have the liftoff so then what happens much more than up in the air let's talk about when math art means deeper giving us a depth perception going further Beyond and things that are inital I'll let you read the other degrees uh essentially what we're going to be doing is taking and completing a loop we're going to start with inverting a process and we're going to end up six steps later also being back at an inversion be able to uh complete a cycle here uh Steven's notes were that Beyond math art as a reified artifact that's ascribed meaning when we go deeper we reach a point where the linguistic meaning has to give over to the meaningful action and the unfolding of meaningfulness this is a qualitative transformation with ontological shifts so just a little reminder about that Dana can we have the next slide so this is going to be the wordiest part of today and I have to read this because it's it starts from a place with due respect to philosophers in our audience and psychologists who are also taking a philosophical stance so I just like to read the following from Kurt Schneider one prospect that is empirical support is a depth psychic psychological approach by depth psychological approach I mean the intimate experience near understanding of subliminal and symbolic Consciousness and its practical applications this approach is informed by a variety of fields in the social sciences the Arts and the humanities but it is probably best understood as a holistic approach to life such an approach has many personal and social advantages that are just now emerging into the mainstream Consciousness one of the main primary advantages is that it specializes in the cultivation of relationships and in particular relationships that support that hold contrasts and contradictions and I would add paradoxes this predicament leads precisely to my call for depth explor exploration for choice in our rapidly mechanizing World whatever economy or infrastructure we create must have personal options built into it and not just cerebral or rational options but whole Bodied experiential options options that issue forth from the core of one's being the depth approach Fosters the self-discovered contexts underlying that's going to become an important theme the symptoms such that the enlargement of one's identity the enhancement of one's capacity for choice and the reconnection with a bigger picture of living further it's important to note that this depth perspective overlaps with but also significantly differs from conventional psychological approaches for example whereas depth psychology stresses experiential engagement that is the immediate affective kinesthetic in the profound in confronting personal and social conflicts conventional psychology stress is more cereal technical engagement with such conflicts the difference between learning about change mechanisms of depression for example and the felt discovery of how depression transforms while both the conventional and death approach approaches pertain to given personal or interpersonal needs the issue here is one of rebalancing the scales the recognition of depth as a complement to metrics there's a couple of things here that I just like to get out of the way and then I'm going to turn it over to Stephen because he has a pretty good idea of the difference between the technical and the sort of depth approaches from the work that he does in the methodology we can go and collect all kinds and volumes of data we can quantify up and what we do with what we have tells us plenty about how our prior experiences shape what we believe the goal of learning part of updating and active inference terms is is data the quantifiable path already traveled complete with decision branches including High occupancy vehicle Lanes as acceleration spaces and off-ramps this is the accounts aspect of an energy application but what are the reconciliation components what must be removed move sculpt prune or otherwise in quotes let go of to move forward qualitatively in order to make progress one must depart from where one was is that letting go to take up a new the same as collecting is foraging for also purging of is congregating winnowing I don't think anyone would be confused logically speaking and say that inverted and non-inverted applications result in equal outcomes as shown in the outline and as we'll talk about further that's why the metaphor of rebalancing in this statement here is intriguing and it may in fact be a category error as described the depth approach examines self-discovered contexts underlying that process does not function on exploitation alone to experience as exploration what we perceive is depth and learn from our experience is not the same as gaining a grip from quantifying to get depth appreciation you have to commit clear and fall into acts of momentary flotation as a sort of a release function that's what we call it lift off whatever traction grip provides that is not the same as moving through space momentarily frictionless due to a push away so The Balancing Act here isn't actually a reweighting exercise it's setting up a parameterized condition of material meaning Gap closing quantifying and non-material I.E Gap respecting qualify it's bringing two categories like math and art together to open new boundaries then thata scale that Schneider here is referring to to be balanced will never appear as balanced given that non-material and non-manipulated non-p pulling Dark Matter effects noted and accepted don't add up to the same thing so one of the propositions today is drop the math art as a bookends gripping type of metaphor and take up a new model a new metaphor that somehow that is somehow between catching and releasing and Daniel referred to that that catch and release mechanism in math stream number one Daniel can you just expand the Miso scale as Frontier and interdisciplinary modeling of for a second so this between this thing is actually labeled or described as misos scale and Stephen do you want to talk a little bit about what that means in terms of not not macro and not micro yeah okay so in terms of getting into these uh flows he was just talking about and these complex Dynamics where you've got lots going on um often in art the the sense of things being understood differently can be picked up and run with and explored also or not so just one thing you know you were saying how things you could take math art in a different way but also as a performer you could say or not so you can drop it and not drop it so these are options okay and one of the ways that um that then starts to come in if you're taking in um and applying what's it like from within you're starting get into agent-based approaches which active influence is an agent based approach in many ways and the MEO scale the scale between the thoughts and the and the feelings and kind of the action scale is used in a number of areas used in chemistry and um it's the idea then of how do you start modeling with inside that um starting to get some tractability starts to come up so there's um from some procedures and processes that give ways to inquire into and give tractable um options to change what could be called regimes of intentionality so someone's in a regime of intentionality that's the Miso scale that's what's going on that's a Dynamics for someone in the moment I'm in some sort of dynamic in this moment now Dean's in some sort of dynamic but often if someone came back and asked me about what just happened they'd be asking me what was I thinking and what was I feeling what's the story of what was going on what is it for yourself and effectively even if I'm given an account of what's Happening Now I'm I'm I'm reflecting back as if I'm someone looking at myself well I'm somehow reporting and depth psychology is seeking to um get closer into what could be called phenomenology but there's also a lot of interesting work where people are actually inside their practices being performers particularly trying to understand the Dynamics and so as well as what we call the psychology world and the phenomenology world going into the world of the generative passages what's the mechanisms that are underlying some of the processes some of which are not going to be available to us in our Consciousness because why would we make those things conscious right we have a quite a useful way of describing ourselves and our story of Life at the scale and aggregation of behaviors that's quite useful but actually the the generative passages the Dynamics of what's going on from moment to moment to moment in that miso scale um is really really useful to understand more about but generally the reason the misos scale is not worked with as much is because it's not that tractable it becomes computationally intractable and um we we'll speak to that and in some ways active influen is giv ways to reveal those Dynamics from um some sort what you could call foundational processes through computation in silicone and what I've been working with and Dean works with in in an educational context Dean may be more where people are stuck and my one is maybe where people found some magic in a in some sort of artistic methodology but either way we're not quite sure how to change those Dynamics and so we have processes to get people into a state where key aspects of those Dynamics can be engaged um on the edge of when they become completely dissociated and too complex and too dissipated so some sort of point where as well as as we've mentioned before the idea of mathematically constructing sunny in silicone can we come in from a miso scale but there's multimo scales so it's not the Miso scale as they got here we we we're looking at different kinds of miso scales in different kinds of regins of attention intention um and that's something the math Arts trying to do maybe bit differently when it's math hyen art maybe different then when it's math art in its different forms and then also what happens when math art is put into another form of art um we're not coming up with answers to that we're sort of saying there's a there's a desire to make that tractable we're not here to make it to give the answer we're just here to give tools procedures methodologies that might give ways to inquire and change so I'll pass that back to you Dean Dan can you just collapse that and put up the Fel lens explanation for me that's just that Orange Box down there yeah perfect so when I was listening to Daniel and ector and shannel last week we were thinking about prisms and we were thinking about lenses and through looking glasses and I immediately thought of okay so what's passing through what here energy right I just thought that the that the Fel lens was a really interesting metaphor because if you read here it says faced with the need to construct a large lens for Lighthouse appropriate of appropriate focal length but unable to support the large weight of a double convex lens of that size French physicist Austin a Augustine fernel reason that it was the surface curvature we're going to get to a curvature moment in the sixth degree here and also as we go on the off ramp here there's a curvature moment that could actually act as a proxy or a substitute the other thing I think is really interesting is says the optical quality is not sufficient for good Imaging because of the scattering you get at the Junctions between the curve segments but there's also something they talk about here which is the inversion aspect of the um the way that the energy is is sent out so we're going to be talking a lot about inversions today and I just wanted to sort of pick up where the Baton left off with the whole idea of so what are we looking through lenses prisms how can we put the energy back Etc can we go to the next slide Danny okay so we're going to we're going to pick up where where people were talking last week where they were going to say let's remove the hyphen let's remove that idea that there's something separating these two constructs what does that leave us with well our argument is going to be that it leaves with us with both a dependency and an opening and we believe that's the case because of two words risk and rewards um why mirrors or Reflections or the idea of holding up transactions is probably not the right metaphor but perhaps rock paper scissors is a lot of back and forthing in between this we're going to talk a little bit about what safe Discovery is in in terms of comparison to something that might be considered on the part of the agent consequential Discovery and we're going to talk a little bit about Nature's Paradox so for the optimizers out there there's going be an awful temptation to skip steps two through five then just tunnel through to inversion to inversion it would appear that we're going to travel around a circle so why can't we just you know look to our left instead of going all the way around the dial if it were that simple remember the time has come to drop a notion of balancing and book ends it's time that we uh let go uh and and reconcile that we might be making a miscategorization mistake that we need to take up and address any any impending natural paradoxes that come about when there is a potential priorities to clash and I think in the presentations that I've seen shanana use in the past in terms of her dark metaphors they've been fantastic because they don't do this they don't bookend things by making math art a thing unto itself we're asking people who are Specialists I for example experts in either domain be it math or art to look at their priors their familiarities differently starting by loosing the perceived grip that they have on those priors the dependencies associated with priors and priorities cannot be gloss over will when w would welding pure math and pure art together cause more problems than opportunities how does the doubt and uncertainty raised by seeming difference change just because approximate going to quote something here from The Book of Mark and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more Twain but one flesh so what then when a management tension especially the management that goes along with integration enter anything is not simple and a major difficulty to overcome one we'd like to discuss today is the need to not assume that bringing things together leads inevitably to new coherences in fact the cost of maintaining the Integrity of one's priors as their priority can often be the first defense mechanism agents construct even before constructing some perceived sense of Common Ground all may find themselves now in the same common situation but what must happen for potential boundaries to become potential leveraging platforms it's good question the vertical wall keeping out becomes the horizontal Launchpad The hierarchical Thinker and the lateral thinker becoming one okay so on the slide we have clear distinctions in detentional Waiting priority on security that's the avoidance of risk versus priority on equating effects which is risk distribution in the form of the situation is prepared through risk minimization and the latter through the parties participating and the collective risk and here's the key difference mitigation exercise in the former the risk is managed by the situation Setter it's an externality while in the latter the risk is managed by the participants themselves note the plural of things like internalities as system simply being okay what we're left with are at least two different perspectives on what existential could mean existential is something Cura by a facilitation meaning a dependency on third parties or as a collective as created as a forcing function given the equating nature of risk distribution the wi and the situation is ours and it's perceived as that irretrievably okay so there's an actual morphism that takes place shanana Daniel any questions so far any thoughts so far because that's an awful lot we're good could I add one thing Dean as you saying that you mentioned about the prior you know we talked about the prior being held onto and that how that becomes important and I think that's something that um is very valid and also very much where the nature of how they're held on to in different fields becomes quite interesting you know becomes quite relevant particularly um in art you might be trying to hold on to two or three constraints and we talked about this is how in many ways art could be seen as a Max entropy process rather than which is the you know the the opposite sister or brother of active inference so you've got that nature of Prior there's a prior belief in what you need to hold on to your process and it can look it can make the artist look a little bit um Primadonna like when they seem to be holding on to something which to the outside world looks kind of incidental maybe but actually that's very key that they hold on to some of those priors around the process and you've got other things in math which I would imagine people want to hold on to for coherence or viability where the math is not just a random set of pretty numbers used as decoration in typography but is actually coherent and in in in in a real mathematical sense happening right so I'd be curious about how priors um and the way prior I thought about in math hyen art math art and how that lands for Daniel you know sh in terms of how they're seeing this this whole field of math art like where do they see the nature of the prior be it for the person um exploring it creating with it maybe people are intentionally then going to show what they're doing to people and putting their name against it maybe the one piece out of 10 that decide is is working and also how it is when people interact with it as a as a a viewer or we're going to we're going to mostly stick here to visual art and that kind of art I think where you've got an artifact and you got a viewer um it gets more complex in other ways and I think for now let's stick with that you've got a piece of art that's been created in some way math art it's it's in a a niche environment when it's going to be presented and it's interacted with and people will calibrate based on feedback based on that right so how does that land for you Daniel or Shana yeah I W to I I wanted to I have thoughts of a miso mathematics flouring around in my head at the moment so um I was wondering um Dean and Stephen like is there anything you're talking about holding on to now is there anything miso to hold on to and I would like to ask um is perhaps the lateral thinker U more dark miso or and the hierarchical thinking like looking glass miso or something like this so uh just wonder if you can kind of relate miso with um these levels of thinking and what you're actually holding on to I say something real quick about one of one of the bits of work that I've done Shannon is so how do we what do we put around a Lial State essentially well how do we recogn and it's back to the same question around of the arbitrariness of Markoff blankets so again I I hate to say this but it's back to openness and dependency so it's it's very it's very difficult it depends it depends and it seems to be able to free itself concurrently it it's how I think the person that's doing the observation is in that moment I'm not I'm not sure how you when you say I'm in a Lial State when I'm in between what does that mean well that can go a whole bunch of different ways right so we're going to talk a little bit in a couple of slides about the difference between an enveloped perspective versus an isovist one but at this point I would not I would not draw it down to uh I can I can nail it down like I can nail down two plus two yeah I agree with you I mean I think and that's also part of the nature of it I mean the nature of it it's slightly intractable from a uh you know from a a defining position because you've got this blending of things going on and you know in in in chemistry it' be you know you'd have a misos scale you have certain Aggregates of um molecules and actually how do they behave as opposed to the individuals or the the macro and in this case well the body the morphological Computing comes in and what I might discuss and I think this is where that Lial is quite interesting is when you step out of what the intellectual or what we would say the mechanisms are cognitive can do that intellectual mostly coming from the vision and the head literally up here where we get grips and we're sort of working on stuff we got a grip on stuff we don't know why but we just do right now we and then you've got that feeling of what's it like at the moment how am I being of which you know I feel it's going okay I've got a gut feeling but I have no idea what my gut's doing I've got no idea what my esophagus is doing and all that stuff right it's going in that Mike leving world right so you've got a meeting so if if we've got this misos scale as let's say we're taking a human and we're doing let's say we're doing visual art and it's got intentionalities then then it's becomes that that the way that regime is structured in the Miso also then shifts you know so I can have a miso where I'm slightly um uh bringing in different Dynamics and the question is how much is that tractable when you said miso maths um yeah where does that uh where does that find itself yeah for me it sounds like uh miso mathematics you can't hold on to it you can't hold on to anything miso but perhaps you can conjure it almost like a patronum it might be a patronum charm anyway Daniel you have anything on that yeah I'll I'll add a few pieces well thank you for these already evocative slides first to the question of the priors and math art one might be looking at a different visual setting like an equation on the wall at a gallery or an equation in a paper and all the different gradients and discontinuities that are in the perception of well that's a mathematician making art or that's an equation which isn't art but it's just being presented artistically or that's art but it's just trying to look mathematical and what do that really mean so how does that looking at the visual equation or other way of representing an equation how does that relate to to what we can observe in our s and our implicit biases about how we interpret the artifact um on the Miso I'll just read a few of these the first thing that I thought of there with the Miso mathematics which was was awesome sha is how in a lot of mathematical settings solving for like one or two might be simple and then the infinite case might be simple but then there's all this complexity in the the few and so that's kind of where the sparsity is in the generative model is if you have just very few connections like one Locus inheritance in genetics and then infinite tiny Loi also can be solved that's statistical but then there's all of the in between and without analytical Solutions in the in between that's where agent based and generative and simulative approaches have come into play for example like like wol from and the simulations taking a forward constructive approach and then also complimenting and following up and foraging with math but using the empirical simulation as part of math work which is also beautiful looking in the simulation so just before we move to the next slide an can I just quickly the uh image the bottom of the slide here is from uh the dock of of my property in British Columbia and uh again if we're talking about miso and if we're talking about Reflections um I think the question is does that does that how do we measure that the complexity of that can you just um reduce it back again for a second down because it leads to the last uh line on that statement which says and this is another controversial statement and I'm I'm putting it out there to be controversial um the Paradox is that math doesn't necessarily reflect art math solves problems art doesn't necessarily reflect math art problem suspends and so I know there be a whole bunch of people that would look at that and go well how how do you get away with saying that well think think for a second if you if there is a tension between math and AR and I'm not saying that there is but for some if there is a tension is it because math generates problems or solves them is it because art solves problem or generates them right and so again we have to look at who who is in that miso scale taking the picture off that dock who's looking at that image of on the front of my t-shirt right we're talking about completely different things okay but could both be considered mathematical sure could both be considered um aesthetic absolutely so it's I think right now maybe one of the ways to keep moving forward and not getting stuck arguing about whether there's something to be gained by math art is to maybe look at this from a risk reward perspective now on that note can you go to the next slide Danny so let's go back to that idea that two has become one it's now math art and it's now a thing upon its or unto itself less byproduct the what of and more the Okay so we' we've now got a single entity it's called math art each one of these uh images that are up here are supposed to express some kind of version of infinity there are infinite Loops here and in many different ways strange Loops especially the Gonzales work with the uh horses but the question then is in each representation can we arrive at an infinite quantity plus an infinite quality and still have something that has seeming to The Observer some sort of existence in which there's it something that is and then something that isn't that image right so I don't know how the mind works through that thing but if it's the thing unto itself can free itself from itself well we must be doing that to understand the infinite ant Loop and the and the images of a person sitting in a chair who's really a skull right or somebody who's going up and downstairs at the same time or literally having time melt away right so I'm not sure exactly how we gain tractability around that other than to say there's this thing it has its limits and then it's not that thing who you are orientation wise when you when your actual place is I can't be either in or out okay as the Observer you're only left with on that misle scale that we just talked about in the previous slide what can best and often is described as between and around both in out math art in out so this is why I don't push back at all with the idea that conceptually it can be a thing now I know it comes from different places but that doesn't mean that our minds Arc capable of seeing it as one thing unto itself this two places at once as boundary as dividing and separating while at the same time containing is where all the interesting stuff seems to happen at least certainly grabs my attention is that the moment we realize that things like identity Observer and observed gripper and gripped releaser and released as reference frames possess this strange quality or a loop Paradox and therefore must be contemplated as having properties that follow a path of dissemination and again this is just my theor theorizing things that spread can contain all those that are affected and influenced things that spread can also divide they can keep apart those who possess from those who try to avoid identity seeks out where it can manifest and at the same time it must be able to free itself from itself it must be able to reconcile if it's to update this is why category theories is such an amazing Theory to understand why and how who we identify as is that realization is very very much dependent on an understanding of boundary between and on and around it's got to be all three and I and I I don't I'm not as not as read up and understanding of category three as shanana is and some of the other people we've had on guest here at the Institute but I can say this it's the only bit of of formalism that I think tries to explain what's going on there which do you agree Shana yeah I definitely think so and definitely the higher categorical models are just even the the notion of enriching a certain category where you can take those on sets and they have a certain structure on them so yeah please keep going okay can I add yeah I was gonna add one thing is as you were saying there that the Observer so you get this interest in positionality particularly with art because the point of it to some extent is to inspire and that happens like presuming like assuming it's an a practice of art which is about that being seen by others right which is not always the case you can have people who do therapeutic art practices and stuff like that but in these cases here the The Observer is a key part of it and you can see these symmetries and these approaches and you wouldn't necessarily need to no math that these things are inherently part of the nature of the structure of it but you can also when you do know math you can see that at the same time so there's an interesting um again the nature of the regime of intentionality around how something's being interpreted then changes how it's positioned even by the same person with their own priors you can slightly change your priors and um position things a bit differently in that respect you know um you know you could so that that piece around um symmetry for instance is a mathematical principle and symmetry is a key part within the nature of art making and you've got this gradation then between how much um then art is embedded with or imbued with math and how much it's particular math practice and um how explicit or implicit that is to the meaning making you could have it where the nature of the mathematical principle at hand maybe the Mobius strip is more of that you go deeper and deeper when you go maybe deeper and deeper into the nature of that math um and in some other cases maybe um I'm not sure with the horses whether how much that's the case right it might be more of some other perceptual question marks that come in so you know I'd s put that out there yeah Dean can I say one more thing before you move on so there is this um you know I think sort of sad divide like in mathematics between they say I'm a Discoverer or I'm a Creator so I'm discovering mathematics versus I'm creating mathematics and so kind of like from that round then math art would be this sort of anti frasal thing right like the Little Giant math art is anti frasal and sort of dismissed so I think that um you know I think what you're like I love this uh in each representation we can arrive at this sort of simultaneous experience of infinite quantity and infinite quality um so I think it's really important to not view that antias um we're all familiar with the Duck Rabbit uh problem my dream is to sustain a simultaneous experience that I'm on math stream too with all of you lovely people and that we're also Cambridge Apostles like at the same time for some reason that seems to be prohibited but I will keep trying but um so Duck Rabbit simultaneous experience infinite quality infinite quantity like to not let that fall into Discovery creation division um and not let that be antias toal I think I think that's what the I'm seeing in that horse slide cool so Dan next slide please because we're g to keep it on keep it on the time limit here we invited Daniel to come in have a look at this um free presentation so there's a question here I'm gonna let Daniel answer it he he's already familiar with what the question is it's it's based on a box in uh the our our Bible um the the active inference text so I'm not going to read what's on the slide here but this is essentially from chapter 2 the low road to active inference and it speaks to probabilistic reasoning as underwritten by two key rules the sum and product rules of probability if you are creating doesn't matter whether you're working in the medium of of paints or numbers I don't know about paints by numbers um the question then is so what element in the probabilistic field does the artist leave enough space open for for the unpredictable the uncertain the artist is sensing the sequentiality of their process and in quotes all possible events X must sum or integrate to one how does that make sense for the sense maker that's why we Wrangle Daniel in early so that he could speak to that from a from a statistical standpoint thank you Dean I'll try to give a a thought on this and connect it to the mention of sparity earlier so we're talking about looking at these two variables X and Y and how they might be connected or not and so there's all these different options how many options we can model that territory or which could be an abstract territory as that's purely clearly up to our creativity so our analysis space is already something that had been opened up and so it suggests that there's other ways to even look at this Beyond even what's written here so if the the connectedness between two things or the correlation or the mutual information or the sum number is like 3 on a probability distribution there's also that point S3 heads 7 Tails except for the third side of the coin so there's the construction of the point three and then there's within the ruler what is left as the other and then going off in the imaginary Direction going off orthagonal to that number line probability is imaginary and there's all these different kinds of adjacencies and imaginaries because just distilling down to the single number it requires a lot of context and other apparatus to make sense within like it's data set dependent if it's empirical and uh this specific box is exploring where and how some of the more fundamental expressions in basian statistics which is kind of one doorway into the broader mathematical statistical everything being connected in different ways and where and how something can be separated out in different ways and what kind of relationship remains statistically so when we talked and this is all all say for now here there's all these different x's and Y it's just a placeholder for relationship and that could be art and viewer art and artist moment and moment cause and effect measurement it's kind of like the Legos of all of those things being combined then this is something that is to logical in in the mathematical area and then in application which is where all the Miso is occurring that's the question about the actual mapping thank you I really pre you could explain that a thousand times better than I could um so we're at the we're at the plateau now the uh the roller coaster has gone up we've leveled off and now we're going to have gravity assist us for the last two slides can you go to the fifth degree for a danum so Shannon brought this up and I I wanted to really focus in on this quite specifically are we going to be talking about an isovist perspective which is one way of seeing framing like we're outside of something and we're looking at it objectively or can we take what uh Brock Mo talks about in terms of an envelop stance an awareness of the the totality around us that that we find ourselves in the situation or the niche the implications for understanding math art as a bidirectional relationship leave it on the relational level and only then as separate di disciplines parameterizing if you can understand the relationship first then we can get into balances and bookings and Stephen and I had quite the philosophical discussion this week really talking about so what's the difference between reflective and transactional versus expansive and interactional and we we're still working through that as as as we go forward but on this slide here there's images of this of the sphere and and typically how this information is presented to us is frames are inside out and outside in you literally are in the book and you bring the book out into your reality or you're outside the sphere and you pay your money and then you get on the inside and and guess what you've you've got a chance to watch the concert what we're asking people to contemplate today is and this is just a way that we've this is a placeholder this isn't we don't have anybody else saying that there's an expansion frame but what we're asking is if we're going to use a depth approach if we're going to keep both eyes open we're not going to let the ma ey dominate the the art ey and so forth what would that how would that be fundamentally different how as Daniel said would that how orthogonal would that be the question of how directionality Works in terms of giving the viewer some sense of what's going on it becomes pretty clear that there may be some Advantage is present in understanding those moments when we take up a view that's reflective transactional and transdisciplinary and second eye open when there's a different kind type category of back and forth four thing in the lower sequence with rocket is taking off the expansion framing process as we've given it a temporary name for there's a massive vertical lift or a step function and step following what someone already knows so there's exploitation and exploration going on concurrently the skilled performers on the stage plus whoever's Manning or womaning Mission Control thinking graphically we've now got an x-axis from which to leverage off of this is quite different than many of the barriers requiring portals that why dimensional walls have us determining workarounds and work throughs for lots of figuring out nevertheless regardless of how much attention we dedicate or are taught about priority of understanding transactions that economic understanding as a priority isn't the whole story to really place a full value on endeavor is an equal amount of study and resources have to be committed to appreciating a coherence present as both Gap closing which is a lot of stuff that goes on in school and GAP respecting which I think you get a a much deeper appreciation for uh when you're floating around and 22,000 miles up at the space station the time required to see the band inside the sphere and the time required to process the event outside the moment as our own self organizing mission control so that's what this is essentially leading us to does anybody have any comments can you catch yourself knowing when you're trying to pass through a vertical barrier either either direction you're trying to get inside the castle or you're trying to get out versus you're trying to leave right that expansion frame is how do we process our trip to the space station and back moments what is that threshold where matters no longer fit within a transaction frame we ask this in the context of when does transdisciplinary end and interdisciplinary begin um Stephen can you say something about this sort of the difference in in what you do can you comment on the reflective versus the expansion and oh yeah so as um so I suppose you've got a sense there that the reflection is um in in terms of the regime of attention you know reflection and even with phenomenology it tends to be a self-reporting on experience so there's this idea that it's a reflection but it's my reflection but that's not my experience that's my reflection on my experience which is my guess what I would see if I looked in the mirror which is almost my guess of what I think someone else would see if they were me looking at me right so you've got this interesting challenge of that reflective frame and then you've got now the way the expansion frame goes out or well I the term there the expansion frame is is kind of that idea of going Beyond that's interesting in the sense that um we we have that's a bit more open and I I in I can there's the the going up into space there the the broadness of the perspective there's also the sense that when you go into space you get weightless right so I can I I can know what it's like through a picture to guess what it's looking like out of a window like I don't know what it's like to be weightless really I've done it a little bit going over the bridge but not that much um and um so there's a there's a question there of when you try and get into breaking out of um regimes that are quite established in one scale um and what does that mean and that can go both out and down it can go all the way down to the SED level right you've got this the Miso scale of each cell of each organ of each region or maybe just the B just me and then you got that kind of me trying to talk on a on a c you know and navigate with the room and thetics and the microphone and the situation so it's quite a variable um it's quite a lot more variable and a lot more varied when you start to get into the the generative passages the Dynamics the then the reflective frame which tends to be this aggregated story tends to be a lot more like this is what happened when I was on the call and you had this story about but actually the Dynamics are changing an awful lot from second to second from moment to moment from physicality to physicality but that's not how we feel it and that's not necessarily how we think about it because well we got to get on with our lives right people who end up thinking about every half microsc of every moment would not get very far right so yeah so we we we we we deliberately don't know a lot of what's going on every moment we just act in the moment to do that just like we we we solicit information with our vision and the Cades outside of outside of our awareness of every Cade that we do right so yeah okay well we're getting very close to the end here we're moving up to the sixth degree in the final slide Daniel again I'm just going to read something off the slide this is uh really kind of cool it's a it's uh my friend and and meme EXT Builder extraordinary extraordinary Daniels image on the bottom left corner and it's kandinsky's uh Blue Sky image on the same page and I just want to read the little passage under it from uh the text from which I drew the the um the Kandinsky image 1889 a research assignment from the Society of Natural Science ethnography and anthropology took Kandinsky to the province of vagda where he was to record The Local Peasant laws well as the remains of the non-Christian religion of the original Syrian population on this trip Kandinsky picked up abiding impressions of Russian peasant culture cultural decorative houses and the furniture the splended FK costumes seemed like a magnificent painting to him after this journey whenever Kandinsky entered a Russian Church where the countless broke chapels and churches in B he felt as if he was in a picture subsequently Kandinsky saw his experience as another source of his artistic Mo artistic motivation now I'm G to read this really slowly because I think this is an expansion IE energy release Zone moment for this particular artist to let the viewer stroll around within the picture to remove sort of the eyes of his perspective to become enveloped in it to force him to forget himself and so to become or morph into the picture become the picture all right so th this is this is pretty interesting in terms of math art it's we've gone a long way we we're back to 12 o'clock or the the ride is very getting very close to where we began but I just want to say a couple quick things now or any present moment to learn about uncertainty you can school yourself up on a probability and Dabble in the abstractions of category Theory and you can find yourself exploring with a heuristic in your pocket the reflection reflexive coraly of uncertainty is not the certainty of hard edges and limits in visual art or mathematical operators probability does limits differently as a betweenness and two surprises as a result of uncertainty can be both good and bad mistakes Mis breaks and remakes okay because there are surprises you may not like things like unintended consequences and prediction eres combinations of things like happy and control and prediction skills cannot fix the costs or the risks of having choices the benefits of having choices that sense that you aren't trapped in a situation a very limited weighs and means massively outweighs the cost but don't eliminate the cost of boundary Crossing attempts where potential failures now include what we describe as sunk costs on that you're just going to have to strap in and be prepared to let's go find out I I always talk about that as wayfinder style but that's me okay you need to accept a certain volume of spur of the moment decisioning in your daily travels and maybe the occasional Apollo 13 13 Sully landing on the H Hudson River anxiety can you take that off as in liftoff as in the off ramp that's why I love the mean that that Daniel created to the math art bacon Emporium of the moment the math art vehicle quite literally informally up on two wheels because the ungrip of the inside tires is now the release moment of spontaneity of impulsivity the let's try to commit and clear and fall to acts of momentary flotation as a release function okay again this is not Victorian wayte scales and bookends it's balancing your Pi policy a little Le weight tacked on here and there to counterbalance the inevitable wobble moments on the wheels of life it's knowing how to get back and go out thank you Daniel fredman one of my favorite alltime sayings now okay it is Loop completion with intention starting and ending with conceptual inversions and anticipated sense of bidirectionality and flotation at the top and the bottom of life's Roller Coaster Waves it is a sense of what could be it is math art Stephen yeah I think this is you know we're near in the end here now and so this sets up a few useful juer positions between broader world of art and culture and ethnography and anthropology and math Arts you know and I think there's an interesting piece here because we've gone through a lot of cultural changes in terms of like a lot of times people think in terms of math you know terms of grids and perspectivism and how we started to go and get the spec IAL drawing and then you have this sense that oh where is the math challenging the artistic nature and I can and the idea of math going into art and then this this this piece here from Kandinsky is quite interesting because you've got there's some influences that are mathematical it's kind of got a folk laic you could see almost influence that's also there that you could see from different probably more native cultures and how much was the art being how much is it being looked at now because we and because it has got an awareness that it had a mathematical component it hasn't has this High art component in it right and which then influence the whole field and has this um embedded unfolding meaningfulness across the whole genre for the last hundred years right and in some ways it's um and how much would that have been lost if say the same painting was seen and it was said to have been done by a folk painter in the mountains of Syria right so you we the way that we try to read into it you know because you're not going to be thinking that the folk you or the folk artist in the mountains had access to mathematical awareness right so you have this interesting Jos of how much the meaningfulness of the art starts to be influenced by the nature of how the creation process happened and how we understand that creation process and then start to read something into it and and that that Fusion like I say in some ways when we say that something is math art without the hyphen there will still be our interpretation of how much math is in it how much art is in it and how much the two together because they're together is it and then how much it's because it's completely something that came out of it that's different like floating through the bless right which is could become this almost like transcendental right in some ways it's almost Beyond culture potentially so um any I think that's quite a nice place to sort of Park that complexity right because there is no answer to that but there is a question like this where comes up a lot in how do you curate art you know a big part of art is how you create it curate it and present it and and how you presented it here and set it up in this case with what we've got on screen or how you have it if you can see the the big version of this in some Gallery somewhere it's part of the and dinsky exhibition which might be different than if it's one piece in a gallery where it's a whole mish mash of um art that happens to be in that Gallery you know so you see that a lot where you get tours of galleries happening now um and they have the Kandinsky tour probably or you have the Bango tour and some you'll have that going through San Francisco's Gallery at some point and through Toronto and through New York and whatever so um so I think that's that that is still still comes back to this Observer position um as well as the embeddedness and and and and the bit that's beyond what we know because we're guessing how they got exactly to where they got to you know there could be we have this idea that this was the magic moment and that might have been when he coughs and he slips right and then that that that oh oh I keep it right so but so there's there's there's what's there in the artifact and we can't ask Kandinsky because he passed away in 1944 right and he probably wouldn't be able to remember anyway um so there's an interesting piece there so I I'll leave it that time's starting to slip away from us so this sort of sets up some pieces for another followup so maybe that's something we can also and if there's questions and any other pieces of feedback just want to do one last quick thing before Shannon and and Daniel we're hoping that the uh the ability to be spontaneous to suddenly jog right when you thought you were going to go straight ahead is what we're trying to build up here is a bit of sense of a license to float that's why this last image really kind of struck a chord in the sense that giving yourself that spontane spontaneity um the the leverage to do that and also to be able to float and become in something as as opposed to just always taking that outside view objective View at it was what we're hoping that now as the as the series goes forward people will entertain that not telling you you have to float if you're a sinker go go for it but if you want to that's what we were hoping for today was to literally open the space as wide open as we could and give people that sense that it doesn't always have to be about the stability it can sometimes just be about finding yourself doing things that you'd never imagin possible yeah Dean can I say one thing before we um kind of wrap up if can you uh back up one slide I think this is all really great and I would love to have you both on for obviously a part two part three um so um brings to mind um something that you know Burrows is famous for saying we're here to go so I love how you're saying you're framing this and we're here to get out and so um I'm I've always been Enchanted by mirrors so this reflective frame it's very interesting to think of how you're going to get out of something like that so for instance um um in Return to Oz osma is banished um into a mirror and Dorothy at the end is able to free osma from the mirror and osma steps through the glass um but it took a lot to break through and get out of like that frame likewise how do you get out of the expansion frame so I think it's really interesting um that like next week we're going to be talking about visualizing a fourth spatial Dimension very difficult very difficult to actually um go there it seems like mental imagery stops and I've always wondered why I say can you imagine a fifth dimensional unicorn um I maybe the third dimensional one but but there's like a fifth how do you do that how why something stops and so maybe their math art will help you get there um that I don't think you can get there with one of them and you're going to need both you know so I just want to say I thank you so much for laying down these actual like tools that we can use and that you left everything open um with a lovely interrogatory so I just want to say thank you thanks for having us indeed thank you yeah it's been very very interesting to have the chance to hear some feedback as well it's great lot to say I'll just leave it there we can continue working on this and I look forward to the upcoming uh discussions and work thanks again guys it's really appreciated take him e
