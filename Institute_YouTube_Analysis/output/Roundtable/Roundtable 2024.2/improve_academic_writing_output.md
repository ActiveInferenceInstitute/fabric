Greetings and welcome. Today is June 28th, 2024, and we are convening for the second quarterly Round Table of this year at the Active Inference Institute. We are a participatory online institute dedicated to communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference. For more information, please refer to the links provided. This session is being recorded for archival purposes, and we welcome your feedback to enhance our efforts. All backgrounds and perspectives are invited to participate, and we will adhere to video etiquette during this live stream. I will now present a new slide containing stable links that will serve as reliable signposts.

As we proceed with our second quarterly Round Table, the agenda will consist of three main sections: first, updates from the Institute; second, discussions concerning organizational units and project scale updates; and finally, a look ahead to the latter half of 2024. To initiate the conversation, I invite anyone who wishes to unmute and introduce themselves or share any initial thoughts. I will break the ice by introducing myself: I am Blue, and I am thrilled by the accomplishments of the Institute this quarter, including the fellows program, our partnerships, and the forthcoming philanthropy program (details to follow).

Next, I would like to introduce John Bo, one of our new fellows this year. John, would you like to say a few words? 

I am Jean Frer, also a research fellow from the first cohort. I echo John’s sentiments and express my excitement about contributing value to the Institute.

Hello, I’m Andrew, an intern at the Institute. I have been involved with various projects over the past year, particularly assisting with the textbook group. I look forward to its revival in a couple of weeks and to witnessing the Institute’s growth.

Thank you, everyone. Now, let us proceed to the Institute-wide updates, particularly concerning our digital infrastructure. The stable links represent just the beginning of our efforts to enhance the accessibility and usability of the services we provide. One of these links will direct you to the ecosystem of the Active Inference Institute. This page will evolve to clarify our mission, the structure of the ecosystem, and the changes it has undergone over time. This resource will serve as a menu or guide to the ecosystem.

Another exciting announcement is our initiative to update the 2023 Institute ecosystem paper. This process will involve multimedia elements and collective exploration, providing an opportunity to refine our impactful visions and to understand the roles of various functionalities within the Institute's ecosystem. We will share more details about this engaging process in the latter half of the year.

I would like to express gratitude to the officers and the board of directors, who recently held their second quarterly meeting, as well as to the Scientific Advisory Board, which has completed its first phase of activities and is preparing for phase two. For further information regarding these positions, please refer to our website. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to our progress this quarter.

One of the most noteworthy developments at the Institute in recent weeks has been the introduction of the research fellows program. Jean Frer and John Bo, would you like to share your perspectives on this initiative?

Certainly. I have been conducting a research project at the Institute for the past two years, titled the Symbolic Cognitive Robotics Project. This project will now continue under the auspices of the research fellowship. I anticipate increased participation and exposure, which I believe will yield unforeseen benefits. My aim is to enhance the epistemic value of my research and to present my progress more frequently, ultimately benefiting the Institute.

I am John Bo, focusing on cognition within large group settings. My research examines how groups comprising thousands or even millions of individuals can effectively collaborate and make decisions in an online ecosystem. I hope to contribute valuable insights to this effort.

I look forward to hearing more about Anna Pereira's work in the coming weeks. This program operates on a rolling application basis, so please reach out with any questions or to complete an application for individuals interested in learning and applying active inference.

On the interorganizational scale, we have initiated the Partnerships program, which establishes structured relationships between the Institute and other organizations. We already have one accepted application, which we will announce shortly, along with several others currently in progress. We are excited to explore how to respectfully and effectively form these partnerships.

A significant update from the past several weeks is the receipt of our 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status in the United States. The link donate.activeinference.institute will soon serve as a platform for providing various forms of financial support. We are eager to learn, collaborate, and identify ways to ensure the sustainability of the Institute while enhancing the accessibility and utility of active inference.

I would like to express appreciation to Fred Frank, our pro bono attorney, for his dedicated efforts in helping us achieve this status.

As we transition to the middle of this Round Table, we will examine project scale updates through systems engineering, particularly Alex's vision for understanding the hierarchical and nested nature of our ecosystem, organizational structure, and project-based teams in 2024. Following Chris Fields's information physics course, we have embraced the Prepare-Measure paradigm. This communication model illustrates the interaction of different systems over time, which could be applied in various contexts.

Over the past six months, we have observed dynamic engagement, with many individuals submitting project preparations and updates, whether they pertain to existing Institute projects or new initiatives. This has generated excitement regarding the continued submission of project-related experiences, and I look forward to seeing this trend grow across multiple scales.

Let us now shift our focus to the education organizational unit, which hosts various projects both within the Institute and in the broader ecosystem. Notable projects include Susan Hasty’s research on negotiation affordances and Ana Magdalena Orta’s work on UNIF Fysica. We will also discuss core educational projects at the Institute, such as the active inference ontology, audiovisual production, and the textbook group.

The textbook group will continue with Cohort 6, which will cover the second half of the book, while Cohort 7 will begin from the start on July 15th. This cohort will incorporate classic elements and encourage collaborative discussions. Additionally, there will be a three-week rhythm for each chapter, with a focus on applying active inference concepts in the second half of the book.

In recent months, we have produced engaging videos, including guest streams and thematic discussions. The recent paper-based live stream series on active data selection was particularly significant, contributing to the ongoing development of active inference.

In summary, we have concluded a phase of work on the Fundamentals of Active Inference project, with exciting updates from the UNIF Fysica project and ongoing developments in various other initiatives. Alex and Holly will now provide insights on the journal project and its recent advancements.

Alex, would you like to share your updates? 

Certainly. I am currently involved in the retrieval-augmented generation project, utilizing a substantial local server to transcribe numerous videos from our archives. This allows us to leverage open-source models for processing and utilizing the transcripts effectively. 

Thank you, Alex. 

As we conclude this Round Table, I invite any final thoughts or questions from the participants. We appreciate everyone’s engagement and look forward to continued collaboration. 

Thank you for your contributions today, and we anticipate seeing everyone at the next meeting. Goodbye.
