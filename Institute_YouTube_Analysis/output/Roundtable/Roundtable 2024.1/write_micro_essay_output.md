The Active Inference Institute is embarking on an exciting journey, and it’s a great time to be part of it. Our first roundtable of 2024 marks not just a new year, but a year filled with opportunities for exploration and collaboration. 

We are a participatory online community, dedicated to applying active inference across various fields. Today, we’ll discuss updates at the Institute level, including our educational and research initiatives. The goal is to facilitate engagement, making active inference accessible and applicable.

Participation is key. Whether you’re a seasoned expert or just curious, there are multiple ways to get involved. You can join projects, attend meetings, or simply follow our updates through newsletters and videos. Each pathway is designed to accommodate different interests and commitments. 

We’re rolling out new programs, including research fellowships and partnership opportunities for organizations. These will not only support individual growth but also strengthen our community and its outreach. 

As we delve into educational projects, from developing an active inference ontology to engaging in audiovisual productions, the diversity of our initiatives reflects the richness of our ecosystem. Collaboration, curiosity, and commitment will propel us forward.

Ultimately, it’s about shared learning and discovery. The more we engage, the more we can collectively understand and apply active inference in our lives and fields. Let’s keep the conversation going, and if you’re interested, reach out. Together, we can make this journey meaningful.
