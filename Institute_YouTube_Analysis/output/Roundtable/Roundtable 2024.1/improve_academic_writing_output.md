**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome, everyone. This is the Active Inference Institute's first Round Table for the year, taking place on March 29, 2024. We appreciate your presence, Alex, and thank you to all participants. We are a participatory online institute dedicated to communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference. Links to our resources can be found on this slide. This session is being recorded and archived, so we welcome your feedback to enhance our efforts. Individuals from all backgrounds and perspectives are invited to participate, and we will adhere to video etiquette throughout the live stream. If you are joining us live, please feel free to submit questions in the chat, which we will address at the end of the session.

Today, we will provide our first quarterly update of the year, including remarks at the institute level. We will also examine the EDAC and REINER organizational units, focusing on our educational and research projects, and discuss our plans for 2024. Before we begin, Alex, would you like to add anything?

Alex: Yes, it is worth noting that we are celebrating our first anniversary and this is our first Round Table of the year. Thank you.

Indeed, a great deal has transpired since our inception, which is why we conduct these quarterly snapshots. Let us now proceed to the institute-level updates, beginning with an overview of our current status. At the center of this representation, we illustrate the institute's relationship with the surrounding ecosystem. We have institutional functions, including our officers, Board of Directors, and Scientific Advisory Board, who guide and steward our organizational units focused on education (EDAC) and research (REINER). Beneath these units, numerous projects will be discussed today, as these projects facilitate dissemination, participation, and engagement within the institute.

Furthermore, we will explore various engagement types related to philanthropy and partnerships. Building on the quantum free energy principle work initiated by Chris Fields in his course last year, we have introduced a dual approach to preparation and measurement. Both forms are open to proposals and measurements of all sizes and are utilized for projects within the institute, as well as for interfacing with external projects. The preparation form outlines the project team's objectives and explicitly details how they intend to enhance the accessibility, rigor, and applicability of active inference. Teams are encouraged to propose varying levels of support that the institute could offer. If minimal support is required, projects may commence immediately, or they may await additional assistance.

Conversely, the measurement form captures the activities of the project team, detailing what changes and learnings occurred. These measurement reports may include contributions to open-source code, educational materials, or even simple reflections, such as reading a page from a book. This process aims to enhance visibility, communication, and the flow of support for projects. Through this project-based engagement model, we hope to create diverse opportunities and structures that reflect the richness of our community and ecosystem.

This brings us to a critical question: How can one participate? There are multiple avenues for involvement, whether on your own timeline or ours. By simply inquiring, you have begun the onboarding process. The website activeinference.org serves as a starting point for deeper engagement. We also have a Discord channel for real-time communication, and you may reach out via email to the Active Inference Institute to initiate a conversation.

As for the projects mentioned earlier, participants can join scheduled meetings or, if those times are inconvenient, they can communicate with project facilitators. The activities page serves as a roster or menu of options that you can customize to fit your interests. For individuals seeking more structured involvement, we offer programs such as internships. Additionally, to stay updated on broader ecosystem developments, we provide a newsletter and video channel, which you may be viewing now.

The pathways for engagement can vary significantly; for some, it may take just 15 minutes to get acquainted, while for others, it may require years of learning and exploration. We encourage participants to engage with active inference literature, watch our videos, follow our social media accounts, and read our newsletter. You may also contribute your work, share knowledge, and remain alert for new opportunities.

As you consider how to engage, we recognize that curiosity is often the first step. If you wish to contribute to a project or learn more about ongoing initiatives, we welcome your involvement. Alex, do you have any additional thoughts?

Alex: I believe it is important to highlight the new approach we are implementing, which utilizes preparation and measurement forms that reflect our progress. This is especially relevant for those familiar with the institute, as it presents developments worthy of attention. For potential participants, these forms offer insight into how they may engage with our work, grounded in first principles, allowing us to organize efforts across various scales.

Thank you. Moving forward, we have more updates regarding the institute. Here is a visual representation of our organizational rhythms: we conduct quarterly meetings, including the current Round Table, and have monthly meetings with our Scientific Advisory Board, which provides informal guidance and insights. Daily interactions occur among our community members as they engage with active inference.

We are excited to announce several upcoming programs that will be developed in the coming weeks. First, we will introduce a research fellowship program, enabling individuals affiliated with the institute to list their contributions in publications and gain access to institutional resources. We aim to catalyze innovative work and discoveries made by these fellows. Future initiatives may expand to include educational fellowships and more.

Additionally, we will launch a partnership program designed for organizations seeking meaningful contributions to the active inference open-source ecosystem. This program will facilitate upskilling and foster regional collaborations, providing organizations with opportunities to communicate their needs to the institute.

Lastly, our philanthropic avenues will allow for both small and large donations to support the sustainability of the institute's mission. We are currently awaiting the approval of our 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. We envision a continuum of giving opportunities, from monthly contributions to larger philanthropic relationships.

If you are interested in any of these programs, please do not hesitate to contact us. Alex, do you have any final comments?

Alex: No, I believe we have covered everything.

Thank you. As we transition to the EDAC organizational unit, I would like to briefly outline our education-oriented projects. The following screenshots represent our activities page on the onboarding site. Currently, we have several educational initiatives, including the development of an active inference ontology that serves as a core infrastructure for the institute and ecosystem, facilitating translation across various languages and applications.

In audiovisual production, we have produced a variety of informative live streams and podcasts, totaling 27 videos in 2024. These include ongoing series such as the Morph Stream, which examines biomedical computing techniques, and the Org Stream, which focuses on organizational design. The Math Stream addresses mathematical topics relevant to active inference. We also feature guest streams, allowing for diverse perspectives within the ecosystem.

If you possess production skills or interest, we invite you to participate in this engaging project, which offers numerous ways to contribute, from curating content to facilitating streams in various languages. We also work closely with the Active Inference Journal to integrate audiovisual materials into our knowledge management approaches.

The Textbook Group continues to engage participants in reading and discussing the foundational textbook by Papo, Friston, and others. Cohorts have seen substantial participation, with nearly 400 registrations across six cohorts, reflecting ongoing curiosity in active inference. All backgrounds and levels of familiarity are welcome, making this an ideal entry point for newcomers.

We are equally enthusiastic about facilitating external projects, including "Fundamentals of Active Inference" by Sanje Namjoshi, which aims to update educational materials comprehensively. Additionally, Susan Hasty is leading a dynamic week-by-week project on collective foraging negotiation.

Please explore the onboarding site to learn more about these projects, their documentation, and how to get involved. Alex, do you have any additional comments on education initiatives?

Alex: It is exciting to see the variety of projects and formats emerging, including personal online learning opportunities in physics and social sciences.

Thank you, Alex, and we appreciate everyone's contributions and commitment to realizing these initiatives within our ecosystem. Moving forward, let us now turn to the REINER unit and our current research projects.

The first project is the RXInfer.JL Learning and Development Group, which explores the RXInfer package developed by Bias Lab and colleagues. We are delving into analytical formalisms such as factor graphs and message passing, working through practical examples ranging from coin tossing to drone flight. A live stream with the package developers is scheduled for next week, where we will discuss its application in active inference.

We continue to investigate avenues in library science, focusing on the archiving and curation of materials, as well as modern language processing and analysis, particularly in relation to large language models. 

Moreover, we are engaged in a collaboration involving symbolic cognitive robotics, led by JF Cloud, which explores symbolic active inference. We have various proposed research projects examining topics such as PTSD, M-theory, and soil biology.

As we wrap up, I would like to share a few thoughts. Daily, we encounter new opportunities for growth and exploration. Active inference presents many avenues for individuals and organizations to reduce uncertainty through inference, attention, and action. 

As we consider our progress, we recognize the importance of familiarity with active inference concepts, the utility of software tools, and deeper technological advancements. These horizons present opportunities for bold actions to advance the active inference ecosystem, demanding holistic responsiveness and inquiry.

2024 is a unique year in which we can reflect on our goals and aspirations. I encourage everyone to engage actively, whether by joining a project or simply expressing curiosity about active inference.

We appreciate your participation today, and I will now check the chat for any questions. Following this, we will transition to our weekly open office hours in Discord, where further discussions can take place. Thank you, Alex, and thank you to all participants for your contributions.
