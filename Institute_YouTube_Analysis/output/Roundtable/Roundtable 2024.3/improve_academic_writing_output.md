**Refined Text:**

Greetings and welcome. Today is October 1, 2024, and we are convening for the third quarterly Roundtable of the Active Inference Institute. We are pleased to host this session at the ACM Institute, which serves as a participatory online platform dedicated to the communication, learning, and application of active inference methodologies. For further information, please refer to the provided links. This session is being recorded and will be archived, so we encourage your feedback to enhance our work. We welcome participants from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will adhere to video etiquette during the livestream.

In today's quarterly Roundtable, we will discuss several updates from the Institute, review developments in ongoing projects, and outline our plans for the final quarter of 2024 as we prepare for the upcoming year. Before we proceed, Blue or Alex, would you like to share any initial thoughts or greetings?

Blue: “Hello! I am enthusiastic about concluding this year with the ecosystem paper and the Symposium. I look forward to 2025 and the updates that will emerge then.”

Alex: “Hello, everyone. I want to briefly mention that during our current and upcoming Roundtables, we will increasingly discuss project outcomes. It is encouraging to witness the expansion of our projects and developments.”

To those watching live, please feel free to submit any questions or comments in the chat; we will monitor it closely.

To begin, here is an overview slide of the Institute. You may take a screenshot of the stable links provided, which will assist you in your journey. You can contact us via email, join our Discord community, explore various projects, learn about the ecosystem, and discover structured ways to engage with us. Stay updated through our video content or newsletters, review our fellows' programs, and consider providing financial support through the various short links available.

As Blue indicated, our primary focus at the Institute for the next six weeks will be the revision of the ecosystem and Institute paper. In 2023, we collaboratively produced the first version of this paper, which included visuals and extensive discussions. We are now entering the revision phase, working toward a second snapshot version of this evolving document. This document will offer numerous entry points and pathways for understanding the relationships between the Institute and the broader active inference ecosystem. It will clarify the impactful actions the active inference ecosystem can undertake, the capacities it can develop, and the necessary institutional support for these initiatives. Over the next six weeks, we anticipate extensive collaboration and discussion, both synchronous and asynchronous. Participants are encouraged to contribute in a light-touch manner, as has been our practice. The enthusiasm and contributions from participants have already been remarkable.

There remains one week to register for this collaborative endeavor. Interested individuals can visit ecosystem.activeinference.institute to complete the registration form. As we progress over the next five weeks, we will organize synchronous and asynchronous sessions to facilitate focused contributions from our co-authors, who currently number between 20 and 30. We aim to finalize the second version prior to the Symposium, creating an important opportunity for participants—whether they are newcomers or long-standing members—to provide input that will shape our direction for the coming year. This iteration will feature new visuals and foster engaging discussions.

Blue or Alex, do you have any additional insights regarding this document or its usage?

Blue: “You mentioned visuals, and I believe they played a significant role in our last version. They not only enhanced the aesthetic quality but also defined the organizational structure of our activities. The document clarified how our organization operates and identified the functions necessary for our institutional framework. Moving forward, we will update the visuals, aiming for an even more compelling representation of our structure and future work.”

Alex: “That’s a great point, Blue. I am eager to see the outcomes of this process. It is beneficial for us to gather expectations from the community regarding the Institute's next steps. This feedback allows us to reassess our position and identify areas for improvement. The evolution of our document writing environment over the past year has been remarkable. Previously, we focused on creating a linear document that was accessible and coherent. Recently, we have been able to leverage this document for various applications, including grant submissions, and facilitate translations for diverse audiences. The potential for living documentation to convey accurate information about our organization and its capabilities is exciting.”

The next significant event on our agenda is the fourth Applied Active Inference Symposium, scheduled for November 3-15, 2024. This event will be free and conducted online. We also hope to organize satellite physical events for participants who wish to host watch parties or live streams. The opening session will feature Carl Friston, during which we will recap the developments in the applied active inference landscape since our first symposium in 2021. Subsequent sessions will include discussions on the renormalization group advances, along with various presenters sharing tools, case studies, and updates regarding their successes and challenges in applying active inference methodologies. Additionally, we will provide opportunities for hackathon-style open-source collaboration, welcoming participants of all experience levels. We will curate questions and facilitate meaningful discussions. More information will be shared throughout October.

Are there any further thoughts you would like to add regarding the Symposium?

Blue: “It is encouraging that our Symposium initiative has become stable, allowing us to host these events annually. Initially, we aimed to determine a format that would be most beneficial for our growing online community. From the outset, we have emphasized the practical application of our topics, recognizing the rapid advancements in theory and research in our field. However, it is crucial to maintain an understanding of how these developments can be applied in real-world contexts. This year, with the advancements in tools and frameworks, such as Eric's work, we are witnessing a closer alignment with practical applications.”

Alex: “I share your excitement about creating an open and pluralistic environment where research developments and applications coexist. It is one thing to discuss theoretical applications, but engaging with domain experts and their existing models can reveal surprising synergies with active inference. I look forward to exploring these points further in upcoming discussions.”

If you are interested in being a presenter or facilitating an interactive session, or if you would like to inquire about sponsorship opportunities, please visit the Symposium page for additional information. 

It is important to note that we will place particular emphasis on the hackathon sessions during the Symposium, aiming to optimize this aspect of the event.

I agree that live interactions, such as chats during the livestream, enhance engagement. Additionally, training sessions can be organized ahead of time to facilitate rapid problem-solving during the Symposium. The collaborative nature of these events can significantly accelerate understanding and application, transforming abstract concepts into actionable knowledge.

Regarding our research fellows, our current fellows—Anna, John FIS, and John Boy—remain active and engaged. They have been involved for several months now, and we anticipate the next round of applications will open in about two weeks. If you are considering applying for a research fellowship in this second cohort, please reach out as soon as possible. We will continue to maintain rolling deadlines for research fellows and other fellowship opportunities. It is inspiring to witness the unique contributions each fellow is making to their projects.

In terms of organizational partnerships, we have strengthened our collaboration with First Principles, led by John Clippinger, as well as engaged in discussions with various organizational partners. These partnerships offer significant opportunities for organizations to contribute to the open-source ecosystem, accelerate their application of active inference, and provide strategic input to the Institute while accessing the community. 

Do either of you have any comments on these developments?

Alex: “Yes, I would like to emphasize that both research fellowships and partnerships with organizations are strategic priorities for this year. The collaborative work we are witnessing aligns with our goals and is producing tangible results. For those considering applying for research fellowships, there are just two weeks remaining to submit your applications, and we, as an institution, are committed to supporting your endeavors.”

The philanthropy aspect of our work continues to evolve. Donations can now be directed towards specific projects through our website. As a 501(c)(3) organization, this may be relevant for some donors. While we are actively pursuing grants, it is essential to recognize that we currently operate as an all-volunteer organization. Donations will play a critical role in ensuring the sustainability of our initiatives.

If there are any comments on philanthropy, I would like to acknowledge the contribution from Upcycle through the live Super Chat. Thank you for your support!

We have also made updates to our social media platforms. The project preparation and measurement forms continue to operate effectively. I appreciate the structure provided by our quarterly Roundtables and newsletters, which help us remain aware of the rapid changes occurring within our organization. We continue to receive project proposals, some of which will be reviewed, and the ongoing open measurement opportunities allow individuals to share updates on their internships, research labs, or companies. These channels will remain vital as our ecosystem expands. 

Alex: “I would like to revisit the slide and offer a perspective as a newcomer. Observing this structure and its connections to specific organizational processes may not be immediately clear to everyone. However, I find it to be a compelling representation of how our organizational processes are evolving based on first principles. This understanding can benefit other organizations by applying similar principles to their operations.”

We will now present a formal organizational summary, including the Scientific Advisory Board, officers, and board of directors. We recently held a board meeting that provided valuable insights. In the coming weeks and months, we will prepare and update the applications and information for these volunteer positions, clarifying the pragmatic and epistemic value that individuals may gain or contribute through their involvement.

Having discussed Institute-level activities, we will now transition to shorter, project-oriented updates. The ontology project continues to thrive, fostering engaging discussions in our Discord community as participants explore AI and natural methods for ontology development. Audiovisual production is ongoing, as is the textbook group and the Active Inference Journal, which is exploring the potential for enhancing transcripts within the textbook group. We are currently approaching two and a half years since the textbook's publication and nearing the completion of six and a half cohorts. We are evaluating how the role of the textbook has evolved and identifying new entry points for participants as they transition to other research projects. We are also exploring ways to connect natural language readings of equations with various situations and studies, promoting collaboration through inquiries and discussions.

In the realm of production, we have released 26 videos in recent months, bringing our total to 539 videos overall. Recent streams included a series of math art sessions led by Shanana Dobson and others, alongside discussions on diverse topics within the active inference domain. Our guest streams have covered a wide range of subjects, including cognitive narratives, biological neurons, and the intersection of active inference with reinforcement learning. The culmination of our season featured a reflective session with Darius from Insights, discussing the successful Insights series. If anyone is interested in planning or curating content, or if you wish to assist with audiovisual production or journal activities, there are numerous opportunities to contribute.

Regarding the Reiner projects, participants can engage in hands-on coding and knowledge engineering. This past month has been productive for the RX and fur JL learning group. We submitted two grants with partially overlapping teams, marking an exciting milestone. One grant focused on decentralized AI agents for personalized solutions, while the other aimed at validating inference for large-scale agent governance ecosystems. We will await the outcomes of these applications, but developments within RX and fur continue to thrive.

As we conclude, I invite any final comments from Blue or Alex.

Blue: “I have nothing further to add; thank you.”

Alex: “Thank you all for participating. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. We look forward to seeing you in our future sessions.”

Thank you, everyone, for your engagement today.
