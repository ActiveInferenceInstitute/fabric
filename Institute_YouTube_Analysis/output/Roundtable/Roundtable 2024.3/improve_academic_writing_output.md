Refined Text:

Greetings and welcome. Today is October 1, 2024, and we are convening for the third quarterly Roundtable of the Active Inference Institute, hosted by the ACM Institute. We are a participatory online institution dedicated to disseminating knowledge and practicing applied active inference. For more information, please refer to the links provided. This session is being recorded and will be archived; therefore, we encourage feedback to enhance our future efforts. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we will adhere to video etiquette during the live stream.

In today's quarterly Roundtable, we will cover several updates from the Institute, discuss developments in ongoing projects, and outline our plans for the final quarter of 2024 as we prepare for the upcoming year. Before we begin, would Blue or Alex like to share any comments or greetings?

Blue: Hello! I am excited to conclude this year with the ecosystem paper and the Symposium. I look forward to 2025 and the updates we will implement.

Alex: Hi everyone! I would like to mention that in our upcoming Roundtables, we will increasingly discuss project outcomes, which is encouraging as we witness the growth of various projects and developments.

For those watching live, please feel free to submit any questions in the live chat, and we will monitor them throughout the session.

To begin, here is an overview slide from the Institute. You may wish to screenshot the stable links provided, which will assist you in starting your journey. You can email us, join our Discord, explore projects, learn about the ecosystem, and discover structured ways to get involved. Stay updated via our videos or newsletters, and consider participating in fellow programs or organizational partnerships, as well as providing financial support.

As Blue mentioned, our primary focus over the next six weeks will be on revising the ecosystem and Institute paper. The first version was developed collaboratively in 2023, incorporating visuals and numerous discussions. We are currently in the process of versioning, moving toward a second snapshot of what will evolve into a comprehensive living document. This document will outline various entry points and pathways through the activities at the Institute and within the ecosystem, clarifying their interrelationships. It will address impactful actions for the active inference ecosystem, the capacities it can develop, the support required from the Institute, and how participation will facilitate these outcomes.

Over the next six weeks, we will engage in extensive collaboration and discussion, both synchronous and asynchronous. Participants will contribute to various pages, making light edits and suggestions. We invite anyone interested to register at ecosystem.activeinference.institute to join this collaborative effort. Currently, we have around 20 to 30 co-authors contributing to these pages over the next five weeks. We will organize synchronous and asynchronous sessions to focus contributions and will finalize the second snapshot just prior to the Symposium. This is a significant opportunity for all participants, whether they have been largely observers or actively involved for years, to share their insights and help establish the direction for the coming year. We anticipate new visuals and engaging discussions.

Blue or Alex, would you like to share any thoughts on this document or its usage?

Blue: You mentioned visuals, and I believe our previous version was visually appealing and effectively outlined the structure of our organization and its functions. As we continue to develop the paper, updating the visuals will be essential, and I hope the new graphics will further enhance our structural representation for future initiatives.

Alex: Thatâ€™s a challenging act to follow! I am eager to see the outcomes of this process. It is valuable for stakeholders to express their expectations for the Institute and reflect on our current status. This feedback enables us to assess our position and identify areas for improvement. Moreover, the evolution of our document writing environment over the past year has been remarkable. We have transitioned from a linear document structure to a more dynamic approach, which has facilitated grant applications and translations into multiple languages, expanding our reach.

The second major event in the coming months is the fourth Applied Active Inference Symposium, scheduled for November 31 to December 15, 2024. This event will be free and online, with hopes of hosting satellite physical events for those who wish to participate in watch parties or livestreams from various locations. The opening session will feature Carl Friston, who will recap the current applied environment and highlight changes since the inaugural symposium in 2021. Following this, there will be discussions on the renormalization group advances, and numerous presenters will share their tools, case studies, successes, and challenges in applying active inference. We will also provide opportunities for open-source collaboration, welcoming beginners and encouraging questions. More information will be shared in October.

Do either of you have any additional thoughts regarding the Symposium?

Blue: It is encouraging that we have established a stable initiative with annual symposia. Initially, we aimed to determine the most beneficial format for our growing online community. From the outset, we have focused on the applied aspects of our topics, recognizing the rapid advancements in theory and research. However, it is crucial to maintain an understanding of practical applications. This year, developments in tools and frameworks, such as Eric Siner's work, have brought us closer to real-life applications, as evidenced by prototypes and operational bots. We must remain aligned with our ecosystem and partners while concentrating on applying active inference and sharing perspectives and developments annually.

Alex: It is exciting to create an open and inclusive environment where research developments and applications can coexist. Hearing from domain experts about the practical applications of active inference can lead to unexpected insights and innovations. 

Regarding research fellows, our current fellows, Anna, John FIS, and John Boy, have been active for several months. Our next review round will occur in about two weeks. If you are considering applying for a research fellowship, please reach out to us. We will continue to have rolling deadlines for research fellows and other fellowship opportunities. It has been inspiring to witness the unique progress each of our three fellows has made, and we anticipate further developments with additional fellows.

In terms of organizational partnerships, we have continued our successful collaboration with First Principles and John Clippinger, as well as discussions with other partners. These collaborations involve financial contributions and donations, providing opportunities for organizations to engage with our open-source ecosystem, accelerate their application of active inference, and contribute strategically to the Institute. 

Do you have any comments on these topics?

Blue: Yes, both the research fellows and organizational partnerships are strategic directions for this year, and we are seeing positive outcomes as individuals work toward our aligned goals. It is important to remember that there are only two weeks left to submit applications for research fellows if you see potential in this opportunity. We are committed to supporting applicants. Similarly, we welcome new organizations into our ecosystem and encourage discussions on potential collaborations.

Alex: A lot is happening with us, from writing letters of support to acting as potential contractors for grants. We aim to collaborate on projects that we cannot accomplish independently. Our philanthropy efforts continue, and the Active Inference Institute now offers dropdown options for restricted donations to specific projects. As a 501(c)(3) organization, we appreciate that this status may be important to some donors. While we are applying for grants, we remain an all-volunteer operation, and donations are crucial for ensuring sustainability in our initiatives.

Now, on to updates regarding our social media and ongoing projects. The project prepare and measure form continues to operate effectively, along with the fellows and partners. We are pleased to have these quarterly Roundtables and newsletters, which have significantly changed our structure this year. We continue to see many project proposals, and we maintain an open channel for individuals to share their experiences, whether from internships, research labs, or companies.

Blue: I would like to address newcomers who may find our structural processes unclear. The overview slide represents significant changes in our organizational processes, grounded in our foundational principles. Understanding how these processes function can be valuable for others, particularly in considering how they might apply similar principles within their own organizations.

We also have a formal organizational summary that includes the bodies and rhythms of the Scientific Advisory Board, officers, and the Board of Directors. We recently held a Board of Directors meeting that yielded insightful discussions. In the upcoming weeks and months, we will prepare applications for various positions, and further information will be made available on our website.

Now, we will transition to project-oriented sections. The active projects at the Institute include the Ontology Project, which has fostered engaging conversations in Discord about utilizing AI and natural methods to explore ontology. The audiovisual production team is ongoing, and we are also developing the Active Inference Journal. The textbook group continues with Cohorts Six and Seven, and we are reflecting on how the textbook's role has evolved since its publication two and a half years ago. As participants progress through the cohorts, we are considering how to update our offerings and incorporate generative AI to enhance mathematical understanding.

In terms of production, we have released 26 videos in the past few months, bringing our total to 539 videos. Recent streams included math art sessions with Shanana Dobson and Friends, guest streams on topics such as reinsurance, cognitive narrative ecosystems, biological neurons, and various discussions related to active inference.

The Reiner projects have also been productive, with recent grant submissions and ongoing developments within the application ecosystem. We are excited to see the diverse range of projects being proposed, and we appreciate all contributors.

If there are any final comments from Blue or Alex, please feel free to share.

Blue: I have no additional comments; thank you.

Alex: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your participation and look forward to your continued engagement.
