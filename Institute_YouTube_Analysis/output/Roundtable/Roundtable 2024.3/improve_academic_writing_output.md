Refined Text:

Greetings and welcome. Today is October 1, 2024, and we are convening for the third quarterly Roundtable of the Active Inference Institute, hosted by the ACM Institute. We are a participatory online institute focused on communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference. Additional information can be found at the provided links. This session is being recorded as a live stream for archival purposes, and we encourage your feedback to enhance our work. We welcome participants from all backgrounds and perspectives, and we will adhere to video etiquette throughout the live stream.

In today's quarterly Roundtable, we will discuss several updates regarding the Institute, review developments in various projects, and outline activities planned for the final quarter of 2024, as well as our preparations for the upcoming year. Before we proceed, Blue or Alex, would you like to share any comments or greetings?

Blue: "Hello! I am excited to conclude this year with the ecosystem paper and the upcoming Symposium. I look forward to 2025 and the updates we will implement."

Alex: "Greetings, everyone. I would like to briefly summarize our discussion before the live stream. For our current and future Roundtables, we will increasingly focus on project outcomes. It is encouraging to witness the growth of projects and developments beyond just specific plans."

To those watching live, please feel free to submit any questions or comments in the live chat; we will monitor it closely.

To begin, here is an overview slide of the Institute, which you may screenshot for stable links that will facilitate your engagement with our initiatives. You can email us, join our Discord community, explore various projects, learn about the ecosystem, and discover structured ways to get involved. Stay updated through our videos or newsletter, and consider checking out our fellows programs and organizational partnerships, as well as providing financial support through the links provided.

As Blue mentioned, our primary focus for the next six weeks will be the versioning of the ecosystem and Institute paper. We drafted the initial version as a large team in 2023, incorporating visuals and engaging in extensive discussions. We are now in the process of versioning, moving towards a second snapshot of what will ultimately be a comprehensive living document. This document will present numerous entry points and pathways through the various activities at the Institute and within the ecosystem, clarifying their interrelationships. We will explore the potential impact of the active inference ecosystem, the capacities it can develop, and the support needed from participants to facilitate these developments.

Over the next six weeks, we anticipate significant collaboration and discussion, both synchronously and asynchronously. Participants will contribute to the document through light touches rather than comprehensive additions to every page. It has already been inspiring to see how individuals have contributed to different sections and made structural suggestions. There is one week remaining to register; please visit ecosystem.activeinference.institute to complete the registration form if you wish to join.

In the following five weeks, we will collaborate with approximately 20 to 30 co-authors who will be contributing to these pages. We will establish synchronous and asynchronous opportunities for focused contributions and aim to finalize the second snapshot before the Symposium. This initiative provides a platform for both newcomers and seasoned participants to share their insights and help set a course for the coming year. We anticipate new visuals and engaging discussions. 

Blue or Alex, do you have any additional thoughts regarding this document or its utilization?

Blue: "You mentioned visuals, and I appreciate the design from the last version. It not only enhances visual appeal but also defines the structure of our organizational activities, illustrating how we operate and the functions we require to support such an entity. We will certainly refine the content of the paper, but we also need to update the visuals to make them even more compelling for our future endeavors."

Alex: "That is a challenging act to follow! I am simply eager to see the outcomes of our discussions. It is valuable for stakeholders to articulate their expectations for the Institute and identify where they perceive we stand currently. This feedback allows us to assess whether our self-perception aligns with that of our community and explore avenues for improvement."

The document writing environment has evolved significantly over the past year. We previously focused on creating a linear document that was readable and accessible. In recent months, I have been able to adapt the document for various grant applications, translating it into multiple languages to reach diverse audiences. This living documentation can seamlessly integrate accurate information regarding the organization, the individuals involved, and their respective capacities into grant proposals, which is an exciting development.

The second major focus for the upcoming months is the fourth Applied Active Inference Symposium, scheduled from November 31 to December 15, 2024. This event will be free and online, with the hope of hosting satellite physical events for those wishing to participate in watch parties or live streams from various locations. The opening session will feature Carl Friston, who will recap the current application environment and discuss changes since the first Applied Active Symposium in 2021. The second and third hours will include live discussions regarding advancements in the renormalization group. Additionally, we will have numerous presenters sharing tools, case studies, updates, successes, and challenges related to applied active inference. There will also be opportunities for hackathons and open-source code collaboration, welcoming participation from beginners and addressing all inquiries.

Blue, do you have any thoughts to share about the Symposium?

Blue: "It is commendable that this initiative has stabilized, allowing us to host an annual Symposium. Initially, we aimed to choose a format that would be most beneficial for our growing online community. From the outset, we have focused on the applied aspects of our topics, recognizing the rapid advancements in theory and research in the field. However, from a systems engineering perspective, it is crucial to understand how these theories can be applied in practice. This year, developments in tools and frameworks, such as Eric's work, have brought us closer to real-world applications. We are observing prototypes and artificial agents operating offline, and we must align our efforts with our partners and participants to ensure our focus remains on applying active inference effectively."

Alex: "I share your excitement about the opportunity to create an open and pluralistic space for research developments and applications. It is one thing to hear about potential applications of active inference in various domains, but having two-way interactions with domain experts can facilitate a deeper understanding of how existing models and ontologies can be adapted. It is an exciting time for us."

We will touch on these points in future discussions. If you are interested in presenting or facilitating an interactive session, or if you would like to become a sponsor, please refer to the Symposium page for more information. 

As we refine the Symposium format, we will dedicate additional attention to organizing hackathon sessions effectively. This could potentially evolve into a primary focus for future Symposiums.

I concur; live chats and the interactive nature of live streams are invaluable. Many training opportunities can emerge from model streams conducted in advance, enabling us to rapidly address uncertainties. Engaging with a team and actively participating in discussions can significantly enhance learning experiences.

Regarding our research fellows, our current fellows—Anna, John FIS, and John Boy—are actively engaged in their projects. Our next review round will take place in approximately two weeks. If you are considering applying for the research fellow position and wish to be included in this cohort, please reach out as soon as possible. We will continue to accept applications on a rolling basis for research fellows and other positions.

Our partnerships with organizations have flourished, particularly with First Principles, led by John Clippinger, and several other discussions with organizational partners. These partnerships involve financial contributions or in-kind support, creating opportunities for organizations that wish to contribute to the open-source ecosystem and accelerate the application of active inference. We welcome strategic input from partners and encourage collaboration.

Any further comments from you both?

Alex: "Yes, I would like to emphasize that the two strategic directions—research fellows and organizational partnerships—are essential for our growth this year. We are already witnessing positive outcomes from individuals working towards our aligned goals. For those considering applying for research fellow positions, you have two weeks to submit your application. We, as an institution, will support your endeavors. Regarding organizational partnerships, we are open to welcoming new entities into our ecosystem, so if you see potential for collaboration, let us discuss it."

We are actively pursuing funding opportunities, including letters of support or potential contractor roles in grant applications. Philanthropic contributions continue to be vital to our operations. We have introduced options for donors to support specific projects through restricted donations. As a 501(c)(3) organization, this designation may be significant for certain donors. While we are applying for various grants, we currently operate as a volunteer-based initiative, and donations are crucial for sustaining our work.

In terms of our social media presence, the project preparation and measurement form remains operational, along with our fellows and partners. I appreciate the quarterly Roundtables and newsletters; they serve as important reminders of the structural changes that have occurred. Many individuals have proposed projects, and we maintain an open invitation for sharing updates on internships, research labs, or companies. These channels will continue to play a vital role as our ecosystem expands. 

Alex, would you like to elaborate on the current slide? 

Alex: "As a newcomer, I find it fascinating to observe this structure and the connections to our organizational processes. The visual representation illustrates how we are beginning to implement first principles within our organization. It may not be immediately clear to everyone, but it exemplifies the practical application of these principles. Organizations interested in similar methodologies could benefit from exploring physics as information processing and incorporating these principles into their operations, as we have done."

We will now provide a formal organizational summary, including the Scientific Advisory Board, officers, and the board of directors. Our recent board meeting was insightful, and we will be preparing applications for various positions in the coming weeks. We will clarify the volunteer roles available and the pragmatic and epistemic value that individuals might gain from contributing in this capacity.

Next, we will shift our focus to project-oriented updates. We currently have several active projects, including the ontology project, which has generated engaging discussions within our Discord community. Participants are exploring artificial intelligence and natural methods to advance our understanding. 

The audiovisual production team has produced 26 videos in the last few months, bringing our total to 539 videos overall. Recent streams include five math-art collaborations with Shanana Dobson and others, as well as numerous guest streams covering a variety of topics, including cognitive narratives, biological neurons, and structured active inference.

The RX and fur projects have been active this month, with significant developments in coding and knowledge engineering. We submitted two grants, including one focused on decentralized AI agents for personalized solutions, which was part of the Future of Life Institute grant program. We also submitted a multi-agent AI safety grant to the Foresight Institute, tentatively titled "Village: Validating Inference for Large Scale Agent Governance Ecosystems." 

The active inference ecosystem has seen exciting proposals from various contributors, and we extend our gratitude to those who have shared their projects, allowing others to engage and learn. 

As we approach the conclusion of our session, I would like to invite any final comments or questions from our live chat audience. 

In closing, I would like to reflect on the significance of our ongoing discussions and the ways in which active inference is assisting us in navigating the complexities of our endeavors. We have explored various perspectives and angles, and I encourage everyone to continue engaging with these ideas.

Thank you all for your participation today. We look forward to our continued collaboration and the exciting developments that lie ahead.
