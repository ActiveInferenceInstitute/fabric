Active inference is a concept that merges psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy to create a framework for understanding how organisms interact with their environments. As we gather for our quarterly roundtable, we reflect on the progress made this year and set our sights on the future.

Today, we’ll share updates on ongoing projects, highlight developments in our ecosystem, and discuss plans for the upcoming quarter. The collaborative nature of our institute is crucial; it allows us to combine insights from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. 

Over the next six weeks, we’ll be refining our ecosystem and institute paper, building on the first version we crafted together last year. This living document will serve as a roadmap, outlining how our institute supports the active inference ecosystem. We encourage participation; your contributions matter, whether you’re a seasoned member or new to the group.

Looking ahead, our fourth Applied Active Inference Symposium will take place from November 3 to 15, 2024. It promises exciting discussions and opportunities for engagement, including hackathons and open-source collaborations. 

As we continue to grow and adapt, we invite everyone to explore ways to contribute. Your involvement can take many forms, from research fellowships to organizational partnerships. Together, we can shape the future of active inference, paving the way for innovative applications and insights.
