**Title:** Potential Vulnerability in Active Inference Institute's Online Event Communication

## Summary:
The Active Inference Institute's online event communication lacks secure measures, potentially exposing sensitive information during live discussions and interactions, which could lead to unauthorized access or data leaks.

## Description:
During the quarterly Roundtable event for the Active Inference Institute, sensitive organizational updates and plans were discussed openly in a live stream format. This raises concerns regarding the security and privacy of shared information, especially as it pertains to ongoing projects, grant applications, and partnerships. The format lacks adequate access controls and monitoring, potentially allowing unauthorized individuals to listen in or record sensitive information.

The live chat feature, while encouraging engagement, could also be exploited by malicious actors to gather information or impersonate legitimate participants. This could lead to social engineering attacks or the dissemination of false information.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Access the public live stream link for the Active Inference Institute's quarterly Roundtable.
2. Observe the discussions and updates shared by participants, noting any sensitive information or organizational plans disclosed.
3. Utilize the live chat feature to interact, potentially impersonating a legitimate participant or gathering insights from other attendees.

## Impact:
The lack of secure communication channels during the Active Inference Institute's events poses a significant risk of data leakage and unauthorized access to sensitive organizational information. This vulnerability could lead to social engineering attacks, reputational damage, and loss of trust among participants and partners, undermining the integrity of the Institute's operations and collaborations. Immediate action should be taken to implement secure communication practices and access controls to protect sensitive discussions.
